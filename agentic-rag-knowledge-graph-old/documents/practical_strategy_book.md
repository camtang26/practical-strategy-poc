So let's get** ****started …**

# 2. INTRODUCTION

Unless we change direction, we are likely to end up where we are headed.

- Chinese proverb

## 2.1. Who Practical Strategy is for

Could your organization be a better place to work?

Well here's the good news … **it doesn't matter **whether your job title is Chief Executive Officer, Marketing Assistant or Production Engineer. Practical Strategy can help **you** make a difference.

However, the further away you are from the **'mantle of power'**, the more energy it's going to take to make that difference.

But then you knew that already didn't you? ****** **

The bottom line? If you're reading this, you're already working undercover.

And in our opinion, the **only** way to influence effective change within your organization … is to get involved in sorting out your strategy.

## 2.2. What is This Thing Called 'STRATEGY'?

**Quick.** Grab a scrap of paper. Write down **your **definition of 'Strategy'.

Does your definition match theirs?

You probably have a whole host of ideas that include words and phrases like 'long-term', 'future goals', 'achieving outcomes', …

And we're willing to bet our **entire collection of rare Tibetan 3-humped camels**** **that you have at least 3 distinct definitions (and probably 4 or 5).

Don't be misled by the apparent simplicity of this exercise. The results you'll find are at the **crux** of most organization's problems with strategy - there is no shared consensus of what strategy actually **is**.

**Getting started …**

First of all … here's one of the **Bigger Definitions** (you may to need cough and clear your throat first) …

**" Strategy provides directional cues to the organization**

**that permit it to achieve its objectives, while responding **

**to the opportunities and threats in its environment".**

**We prefer something a little more digestible …**

***"WHAT you want, and HOW you're going to get it."***

And over the next few chapters, we'll explain exactly what we mean.

## 2.3. The 6 Myths of Strategy

**Myth** *noun; *a story about superhuman beings of an earlier age.

Given that so many people misunderstand what strategy actually is, you'd be forgiven for thinking that it was indeed the stuff of superhuman creatures.

Which of course it's not. It's common sense, plain and simple.

Lets start with the biggest myth of them all …

### Myth 1: Strategy Development And Strategy Implementation Are Two Separate Activities.

**No.** Much of this myth springs from the widely held belief that Strategy is about the senior management team getting together for a '***Strategic Session'***

Everyone is encouraged to **'think outside the square',** and lots of new ideas are generated.

After much debate, a broad consensus is discovered around a few good ideas (which someone has remembered to write down).

A few weeks later, these ideas are given a bit of structure

**Note**: whilst developing the 'Strategic Plan', not enough time was made to talk about the budgets that support these new ideas (because budgets are boring, and the CFO always sorts all that complex spreadsheet stuff out anyhow).

This concludes the **Strategy Development** Phase

The Senior Management Team then presents the 'Strategic Plan' to the rest of the organization.

The 'Middle Managers' are then told …

Now at this point, a few of the **middle managers**************** **are thinking two things:

' Why wasn't I consulted about this? 'This new idea about 'optimizing 	the xyz process will never work, because …' and,

'I don't have enough money in my budget to do all this new stuff.'

And of course, they're also trying to run the day-to-day business whilst **maintaining the impression** that they're supremely competent and worthy of future promotion.

… so they stay quiet about their concerns and try the best they can to carry out the wishes of the Senior Management team.

This concludes the **Strategy Implementation** Phase.

### Myth 2: Strategy is a Senior Management Issue.

**No**. Every person in your organization has a role to play in strategy.

Sure, the senior management team is **ultimately responsible** for making sure the company is moving in the right direction (although some senior managers duck this responsibility, preferring to load up their busy schedule with 'functional' responsibilities – but that's another book…), but other people need to be involved too.

Whether it's a middle manager contributing towards the development of the company's new logistics approach, or a front-line employee delivering a new service to a customer that will grow a new revenue stream, **it's a strategy issue.**** **

### Myth 3: Strategy is a Once a Year Exercise.

**Everything changes **- all the time. Your job, your customers' needs, your family, your political opinions, the cells in your spleen. **Everything.**** **

So why on Earth should we sit down once a year and try to predict the future. The future isn't a 'year from now'. The 'future' is what your competitors do tomorrow, and what your customers read and believe in the newspapers next weekend.

Strategy is only ever a hypothesis. It's a theory. 'If we do this, hopefully we'll get that … "

Bottom line? Strategic issues need to be addressed on a regular basis, with small adjustments and fine tuning being the norm.

### Myth 4: You Need a 'Big Brain' to Think About Strategy.

Sure, understanding the environment in which your organization operates, and how you should position yourself, takes a bit of intellectual grunt.

But most people in your organization are already using their brain pretty effectively … **so why can't we** tap into the organization's 'group intellect' to discover **WHAT** we want, and **HOW**** **we're going to get it?

Surely answering these two simple questions can't be that demanding?

### Myth 5: Strategy is a Budget.

**'15% on sales, 10% off costs'.**

Because they don't have an effective strategy process, this type of statement ends up being the strategic plan in many organizations.

Sure, it kind of answers the '**What**** **do we want to achieve?' question … but where's the '**How**** **are we going to get it' part?

Organizations that manage by budget alone tend to rely on familiar (and often **ineffective**) activities. You know what we mean - pushing the sales force for short-term numbers even harder, **cutting back** on expenses like marketing and staff development.

…creating the kind of environment that everybody wants to **get out** of - especially the good people.

Budgets flow **from** strategy – not the other way round.

### Myth 6: Strategy is Complex.

If your strategy process is complex, you have two problems:

1. You'll take forever to agree what your strategy actually is, because many 	of the managers you need to involve don't have the **time** (or inclination) 	to get their head around complexity.

And, **most of all** …

2. Unless you can **capture the**** essence** of strategy on an A4 piece of paper that makes sense to any employee 	in your organization - it's wasted.

Most of the effort required for strategy is in the **execution**, and if people don't **'get it'** … they're certainly not going to **'do it'.**

One of the keys to good strategy is **simplicity.**

## 2.4. Alignment and The New Economy

**It doesn't matter** whether you're a **niche pump manufacturer** from Sweden, a business college in Nebraska, or a dot-com that sells puppy food.

…the only thing that's going to keep you on top is you're organization's ability to **remain competitive**.

And the future isn't what it used to be.

For the last 100 or so years, many companies succeeded by **deploying capital and equipment** quickly and effectively.

That's not good enough these days, when your most important source of competitive differentiation **walks through your doors** every morning, and leaves every night.

If you can align your organization behind** ****common goals**, set individual expectations that motivate, and give people the best tools for the job, you're well on the road to success.

Practical Strategy helps you do this.

## 2.5. Your Organization is Unique, You Need a Unique Strategy!

Think about a successful person you know.

What is it that makes them so successful? Their job? Their attitude? Perhaps their lifestyle? Or simply just **a little bit of lots of things?**

Which means that you can't afford not to develop your own strategy from the ground up - building on your strengths and past successes.

Unless of course you want to work for a **'me too'** organization with no personality …

## 2.6. Local Government and Not-For-Profit Organizations

The advice provided in Practical Strategy **doesn't only** apply to commercial organizations.

The knowledge and action plans in each of the chapters are **equally applicable** to not-for-profit organizations.

The new work culture doesn't just apply to companies striving to make a margin. Local government and not-for-profit agencies also need to improve how to **effectively deliver services** based on community needs.

Indeed, given the importance of non-financial outcomes in such organizations, some would say that they're a **natural home** for such an approach.

## 2.7. Our Proven 6 Step Process

We've been working in the organizational improvement and strategy arena for several years and have developed an innovative approach that works.

Here's a quick summary of what's coming…

### 2.7.1. Identify Your Challenges and Opportunities

Many people (and organizations) jump to solutions without fully understanding what the problem is. Don't be one of them.

Your organization has unique **issues and aspirations**. You need to be to discuss and agree them amongst your senior team.

We take you step-by-step through this analysis process, providing a **solid foundation** to begin developing your strategy from.

### 2.7.2. Develop Your Strategy

If we had a penny for every executive who's told us ' I know how to develop strategy', we could have retired quite a few years ago.

But the thing is - most of them are **half right**. They know where they want their organizations to go they just don't know how they're going to get there!

Our chosen approach to strategy development builds on a **clear understanding** of your organization's challenges and opportunities (from the previous chapter).

This process applies to organizations starting from scratch, and to those who already have some kind of strategic plan in place.

Once we've helped you define your strategic objectives, we'll show you how to weave them together through the powerful simplicity of **cause-and-effect** thinking.

### 2.7.3. Build Your Measures

Practical Strategy **simplifies this jargon** and helps you identify what things you should really be measuring in your organization.

You probably have zillions of measures. Which are the right ones? Should you drop some? **What price** are you paying for complexity?

Once you've defined your strategic objectives, **we'll help you select** the key measures that support them – making sure that they're a **balanced mix** of qualitative (gut feel) and quantitative (hard numbers), as well as a good selection of lag measures (review) and lead measures (forward-looking).

### 2.7.4. Align and Implement Your Projects

The modern workplace is becoming less about doing the same activity every day, and more about **delivering value** through project work (projects are sometimes also referred to as 'initiatives').

The problem is … most management reporting systems don't allow for any kind of **feedback** on what projects should be started, continued, or in many cases, cancelled.

**How much** money, time and effort is being expended on all the separate one-off projects occurring in your organization right now?

Who's got the **overview?** Who's making sure that they're all supporting your strategic goals?

This chapter helps you implement a **simple and effective** Project Management and Reporting framework that's linked to your strategy.

### 2.7.5. Report & Communicate

Once you've made some progress, you'll quickly realize that you have lots of **different bits of information** all over your organization - strategies, scorecards, projects and measures.

The managers in your organization need to have easy access to this information and be able **make sense**** **of it all. And in the majority of cases, this will involve technology – specifically a scorecard technology solution.

You could try a paper-based system, or an in-house development that combines email, spreadsheets and some kind of database.

If you're serious about improving your organization, you're going to need a technology solution that **focuses on strategy and performance management** in an effective fashion that your people can easily use.

And because technology purchases tend to operate in the land of **'smoke and mirrors'**, it's likely you're going to need some sound independent advice.

We have quite a bit of experience in this field ... which you'll find in this chapter.

### 2.7.6. Keep The Commitment …

Once you've got your initial strategies up and running in your organization, you need to maintain the **momentum**.

People come; people go … systems are the glue. It's important to embed your **organization's new thinking** into your business processes.

Poor scorecard administration is often the **silent killer** in many organizations. Don't get caught in this trap. Identify **owners** for important tasks. Technology helps **a lot** here.

**Reviewing your strategies** on a regular basis keeps you on top … and it doesn't have to be a massive time-consuming exercise.

Once people stop talking about 'the new approach', and start taking about your organizations goals and issues – you'll know you've got it right.

Essentially, this chapter help you **get the most** out of your investment.

## 2.8. How Long Will This Take?

Good question.

You won't be surprised to hear that **it depends ...**

On how **experienced you are** with organizational change, how much organizational power (and budget) you have, how much of your organization you're tackling, and not least the complexity of your organization and industry.

So … depending on these factors, implementing Practical Strategy in your organization is likely to take you between **3 and 12 months.**

You'll definitely **hit the ground running** if you have a reasonable working knowledge of your existing business processes, measures and technologies.

## 2.9. The Hunger Busters Case Study

It's pretty widely accepted that **learning from practical examples** is a great way to acquire new knowledge.

**Why** have we chosen a fast food chain? Two reasons:

**You've probably experienced** the products and services of a fast food chain. Which means you're half way to understanding their business model and the kind of issues they face (compared to a niche Latvian basketball manufacturer for example) ;-)

We've applied all this thinking in the fast food industry in the past, so we can bring a **healthy dose of reality** to the case.

So before you do anything else, take a few seconds to **familiarize yourself** with what's happening at Hunger Busters …

**Company ****Background**

Hunger Busters Limited is a fast food chain of quick service restaurants with **250 restaurants** in Australia and 70 in New Zealand. They are the smallest subsidiary of AH Investments, with revenues of A$400 million.

After several years of market growth offering "the biggest, best burger in the land", the company is now preparing for **another growth spurt**, investing in new restaurants, branding and market development.

Over the next three years they expect to **add an additional 150 restaurants** (64 in Australia, 36 in New Zealand, and 25 each in Singapore and Malaysia). They also have **joint ventures** in warehouse facilities and freight forwarding throughout Australia and New Zealand.

The Board of Directors has been asking for changes that will enable the organization to prosper into the millennium. Specifically, they have asked for **increased visibility** on strategy and initiatives that will improve the share price.

**Introducing**** ****Lara …**

Lara DeMarchi is a **senior manager** at Hunger Busters.

Lara's skills and abilities are highly respected by her colleagues, and she is widely regarded as an active . After much research, she has decided that the Practical Strategy approach is an excellent way to improve the business.

We'll be **following Lara's progress** throughout the following chapters.

## 2.10. Your Personal Action Plan!

Sentiment without action is the ruin of the soul.

- Edward Abbey

**How many** business management books have you read and thought 'Wow, that's a great idea!' And **be honest**** ****-** how many of those ideas have you taken action on?

Which is why every chapter of this guide ends with a **Personal Action Plan,** explaining very clearly, step-by-step, what you have to **DO** with your knowledge.

**The ability to take action** is the single biggest differentiator between those who succeed and those who don't.

OK, that's the Introduction over. Lets **keep moving …**

# 3. PRACTICAL STRATEGY: AN INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT APPROACH

This chapter outlines **what** the Practical Strategy approach is, and **where **it came from.

It covers…

What we mean by an **'Integrated Management Approach'**

What a Balanced Scorecard is

Our view of the **Four Perspectives**

**Thinking ****@**** Levels**

Traditional vs. Contemporary Approaches to Strategy

**Game Plan **Thinking

## 3.1. What Does 'Integrated Management Approach' Mean?

Practical Strategy is an integrated management approach, consisting of **six key stages,** all of which are covered in detail within this guide.

Figure 3.1

In its simplest form, this guide can be regarded as a practical** 'How To' manual** on the ******* **created by Robert Kaplan and David Norton.

However, this guide goes much further, by outlining a **framework** that supports an **entire management philosophy.**

So what was **wrong **with the 'standard' scorecard approach? In our view - not a great deal.

***** All material relating to the Balanced Scorecard in this guide is driven by our interpretation and practical implementation experience of Kaplan and Norton's work, unless directly quoted.

Unfortunately, some organizations and consultants searching for the next **'quick fix'**** **have labeled the Balanced Scorecard as a performance management tool, rather than an integrated strategy approach that covers strategy formulation and implementation.

Further, the knowledge and application of strategy has moved a **long way** since the introduction of scorecards as a balanced suite of performance measures linked to objectives, across** Four Perspectives**.

**Note:** we use 'scorecard' interchangeably with 'Balanced Scorecard'.

## 3.2. Four Perspectives: The Practical Strategy View

You probably already appreciate that almost everything that happens in your organization has a **flow-on impact** at some point in time (cause-and-effect). You lose your star Sales Manager and your revenue figures take a small dip for a while.

Or you **improve the usability** of your most popular widget, and the number of technical support calls drop significantly.

Every organization has challenges & opportunities resulting from **cause-and-effect** relationships. These relationships can best be understood by viewing them from **Four Perspectives,** which are the building blocks of any strategy.

OK, so what are these **Four Perspectives?** The generic view is…

**Financial**

**Customer **

**Internal Process**** **

**Learning & Growth**

These generic Four Perspectives are derived from the Balanced Scorecard developed by Kaplan and Norton during the 1990's.

Our major **issue** with the generic perspectives is that the 'Customer Perspective' implies a myopic focus on customers, excluding other critical groups that organizations need to target.

We prefer the term 'Stakeholder Perspective', as it accommodates the value added to organizations by including both customers and other critical stakeholders such as Partners, Suppliers, Government Agencies and Competitors.

Our suggested Four Perspectives are:

**Financial**** **(make a return)

**Stakeholder **(identify and satisfy needs)

**Process**** **(create value)

** Innovation & Growth** (develop and utilize resources intelligently)

## 3.3. What is a Balanced Scorecard?

Despite it's apparent simplicity, this question is quite difficult to answer.

We believe there is now **no one all-encompassing definition** of what a Balanced Scorecard is. In our opinion, the Balanced Scorecard has continuously evolved, and we see at least **three distinct versions **operating within organizations.

**Balanced Scorecard** as a **Measurement Tool.** In 1992, Kaplan and Norton released a series of Harvard Business School articles that introduced the scorecard approach as a strategic measurement tool. Many organizations still hold this 'measurement focused' view.

**Balanced Scorecard** as a **Strategic Implementation Tool****. ** It appears from published client experiences, Kaplan and Norton realized that the Balanced Scorecard could, and should, be regarded as much more that just a measurement framework. In their 1997 book, *The Balanced Scorecard – Turning Strategy into Action* they focused on the scorecard as a strategic implementation approach.

]

This approach has been reinforced with their latest book, *The Strategy Focused Organization*, released early 2001.

**Balanced Scorecard** as an **Integrated Management Approach** (The Practical Strategy framework). From our research and practical experience we found that many scorecard implementations had a number of failings. Specifically, they didn't …

Use the process as a strategic management framework (often merely viewed as a **'tool')**

Treat strategy as a **dynamic process**,

Use the process of strategy widely enough in the organization (usually corporate only), and

Integrate effective** technology **that supported and communicated the strategy process.

The Practical Strategy framework builds upon existing scorecard thinking to address these issues.

One of the **key conceptual differences** between the Practical Strategy approach and Balanced Scorecard thinking is…

## 3.4. The Secret Ingredient: Thinking @ Levels

A common problem we've come across when working with strategy is that many managers treat strategy as if it applies at only one level **(mostly corporate)**** **of the organization.

However, the **real power** of strategy comes from cascading and communicating it throughout the organization.

One of the foundations of the Practical Strategy approach is the recognition that strategy** operates at multiple levels**, simultaneously, within every organization.** **

So, **what are** these strategy levels?

The answer to this question largely depends on the **size and complexity** of your business and industry, but **generally** there are 3 strategy levels in most organizations.

Level 1 - Corporate

Level 2 – Strategic Business Unit (SBU)

Level 3 - Operational

You may easily identify with these levels, as they reflect **many existing organizational structures**.

Smaller organizations may have less than three, and very large organizations are likely to have more than three – perhaps even five or six.

Strategy levels in most organizations generally, **but not always**, correlate with the organizational structure.

Let us explain further by way of example…

For a **global technology company** (eg. IBM), the strategy levels may be:

Global – Worldwide issues

Regional – eg. Europe, Africa, Asia etc

National – eg. Australia

Territory - eg. New South Wales

Operational – eg. Sydney

Or

Corporate – All Business Line Issues

Strategic Business Unit (SBU) – e.g. Hardware, Software, etc

Regional (by SBU) – e.g. Asia Hardware, Asia Software, etc

Country (by SBU) – eg Australia

However, for a **national company** (eg. Telecom Australia), the strategy levels would most likely be:

Corporate – Total Company

Business Unit – eg. Residential, Mobile, Long Distance, etc

Operational – eg. Retail, Distributors

And for a company operating in a **smaller geographic region** (eg. Washworld California), the strategy levels may be:

Corporate – Total Company

Operational – eg. city or outlet

We'll be building on this concept throughout this guide.

However, at this stage, you need to understand that **Thinking ****@**** Levels** fits within contemporary strategic thinking.

## 3.5. Traditional vs. Contemporary Approaches to Strategy

In 1984, George Day offered the traditional view of the strategy process, which is still the predominant view within most organizations.

Figure 3.2

This view is a typical **'top down'** approach to strategy

In 1995, Mintzberg and Walter's research emphasized that the process of strategy development is **considerably more complex** than any formal strategic formulation process alludes to.

Further research by Weitz and Wensley in 1988 emphasized this view. Stating that '**feedback loops** arise between stages … 'the 'top down' approach is good as an outline, but as already alluded to; strategy is not a simple process'.

And later, in 1989, Ries and Trout stated "strategy should be developed from the** bottom up, not top down**."

**In other words**, strategy should be developed from a deep knowledge and involvement in the actual operational dynamics of the business.

Figure 3.2 shows how the Practical Strategy approach uses both the 'top down' and 'bottom up' thinking developed by business schools over the last three decades.

Figure 3.2

The associated colors in Figure 3.2 show the typical attention shown by management in the past, (**Red** – Full, **Blue**** **– Little, **Yellow** – Consistent).

To **summarize** the differences between the two approaches...

Traditionally, strategy has been viewed as the **domain of senior management**.

They would set the direction, whilst operational managers would implement these ideas through **plans or tactics.**

However, for decades, this implementation process has failed to deliver the results desired by organizations.

**Why? **

Because this approach largely **ignores** the vertical (top to bottom) and horizontal (across business unit and departments) communication and integrated actions that are required to deal with **perpetual change.**

The Practical Strategy approach builds on the traditional view, and incorporates the best of contemporary thinking – providing managers with a **flexible framework** that focuses effort and accommodates change.

## 3.6. Introducing … The Game Plan

Another **clear area of differentiation** between the Practical Strategy approach and any another strategy approach is something we call 'The Game Plan'.

Think of it as an organization's **'Biggest Picture'.**

Specifically, The Game Plan graphically shows the relationship between different **Strategic Themes.**

We'll cover strategic themes in much more detail over the next few chapters. Suffice to say at this stage that a Strategic Theme defines **WHAT** an organization wants to achieve (as opposed to HOW they will achieve it).

The Game Plan allows all managers to understand the influence that each strategic theme has in creating the organization's desired outcomes.

We'll be covering Game Plans in more detail soon, so for now here's a** ****quick example …**

**Figure 3.4**

## 3.7. Where Did Practical Strategy Come From?

**You may be wondering** where Practical Strategy has come from (or whether we've simply made it all up!).

We've been working with corporations and strategic business units building and implementing scorecards for over **four years.**

We've also had **practical experience** across a significant chunk of the business spectrum …

We realized a few years ago that although many organizations had heard of, and in some cases implemented, a scorecard, most were **struggling** with the practicalities of the concept.

We carried out a bit of research, and found that the desire **for practical advice**, combined with both the unwillingness to engage an expensive consultant and the fast-growing acceptance of the Internet as a knowledge tool, spurred us into action.

Anyhow, that's enough about us. Let's move onto one of the most **important** chapters in this guide …

## 3.8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

How does the Practical Strategy approach fit with traditional business planning?

In our view, most organizations view 'business planning' as a discrete, once-a-year activity performed by some organizations to establish annual goals and budgets.

Practical Strategy goes beyond traditional business planning … by ensuring strategic issues are addressed on a continuous basis.

Planning is often treated an activity that gets in the way of 'real business'. Whereas Practical Strategy is a management philosophy for dealing with continuous change – which is what 'real business' is all about.

This issue is further addressed in our on traditional vs. contemporary approaches to strategy.

# 4. IDENTIFY YOUR CHALLENGES & OPPORTUNITIES

The **purpose** of this chapter is to get your senior management team to **discuss and agree** what the key issues facing your organization are.

**Note:** an 'issue' can be either a challenge or an opportunity.

You need to be crystal clear on these issues, as they form** ****the basis** of all your strategy development work that we'll be covering later.

This chapter provides you with the **knowledge and tools** to identify your unique organizational issues, and also gives some important tips on how to prepare and run your senior management meeting.

It's worth highlighting at this point that one of your key **early success factors** will be your ability to engage your senior managers, so please read carefully.

You'll find that this chapter (and the next 5 chapters), have a **Common Format:**

First of all, we share our **Knowledge** with you

Then we provide a **Case Study** that puts this knowledge into context

Then it's your turn – with your **Personal Action Plan**.

**IMPORTANT:** To get the most out of this chapter, **read it all the way through first.** Don't concern yourself with actually **doing**** **anything at this stage - that comes later in your Personal Action Plan.

## 4.1. How Much of Your Organization Are You Tackling?

One of the earliest decisions you're going to have to make is **how much** of your organization you'll be applying the Practical Strategy approach to.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a much better understanding of which approach will suit you best. In the end, the decision has to be made by your CEO, so please make sure you **understand the implications** of adopting the Practical Strategy approach before you brief them.

OK, so let's get started with the **analysis …**

## 4.2. SWOT Analysis: A Great 'Brain Warming' Exercise

SWOT analysis has **three key aspects** that we like:

It is relatively **easy to use**

It focuses on both **internal and external** issues

When used in a group environment it gets people in the right state of mind to really think about (and challenge) the status quo.

Thus if nothing else, SWOT **gets people thinking**. And because you usually don't have to teach people SWOT, you can get them focused quickly.

SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities & Threats) is a **simple****,** easy-to-understand technique that can be used to help formulate strategies.

It is the examination of an organization's **INTERNAL** strengths and weaknesses, and its **EXTERNAL** opportunities, and threats.

It is first and foremost a tool to be used in the **early stages of decision-making.**** **Which of course is why we're using it here!

### 4.2.1. The Key Benefits of SWOT

A good SWOT analysis gives your organization an **overall picture** of its present situation in relation to the industry, competition and community in which it operates.

Such **foresight** often kick-starts new projects and strategies that replace redundant ideas.

### 4.2.2. The Drawbacks of SWOT

SWOT Analysis usually reflects **existing positions and viewpoints**, which can be misused to justify a previously decided course of action rather than used as a means to open up **new possibilities.**

It's important to note that sometimes threats can also be viewed as opportunities, depending on the people or groups involved.

Remember …

"A pessimist is a person who sees a calamity in an opportunity,

and an optimist is one who sees an opportunity in a calamity."

### 4.2.3. Right, onto How to DO it …

The first step in a SWOT analysis is to make a **simple diagram** by drawing a cross, creating four sectors; one each for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats*. *

Figure 4.2 - SWOT worksheet

The next step is to **list specific issues** related to the problem at hand, under the appropriate heading in the worksheet. We've found that it's best to limit the list to **10 or fewer points per heading.**** **

One final point: There is real power in **specifics **… so don't generalize too much.

A Simple SWOT Example

Strengths: **Innovative team culture**, financial stability.

Weaknesses: Poor telecommunications, **staff turnover.**

Opportunities: **Rapidly growing market**, technology convergence.

Threats: New mergers **attacking market share**, poor industry skill levels.

As with any SWOT Analysis, remember the **Internal** nature of the Strengths and Weaknesses, and the **External** focus of the Opportunities and Threats.

The Hunger Busters Case Study takes you **step-by-step**** **through the SWOT process, with detailed examples.

### 4.2.4. SWOT Analysis Outcomes

Here is a list of **important questions** you should be looking to answer as part of your SWOT analysis**:**

Do you **dominate the market** in which you operate? Are you a follower or a leader? Where do you want to be?

Is your market (or product line) **growing****,** static or declining?

What is your **market share?** What do you need it to be?

How **competitive **is your market? Where are your competitors going? Are they building, maintaining, defending or withdrawing?

What is your **source of competitive advantage?**** **Economies of scale, supplier relationships, great service, image?

Do you understand where you're at within your **product life cycles?** (Introduction, growth, maturity and decline)

Are you confident that you have the **organizational competence** to achieve your goals?

How do you **segment** and target your markets?

How are you **building relationships** with your customers?

**Note:** You may not be able to adequately answer some of these questions due to lack of information (eg. market knowledge). Don't be too alarmed about this, as the Practical Strategy analysis process is designed to help you identify not only what you do know, but also what you don't.

Many organizations **stop their analysis** at this point, believing that the information they have gleaned from their SWOT is sufficient to start building strategy upon.

The problem with this approach is that the information isn't in a **'workable'** format to allow effective strategy implementation.

Enter **Perspective Analysis…**

## 4.3. Perspective Analysis

Once you've completed your SWOT analysis, it's critical to look at the information you've gathered from a slightly different perspective.

Well, **Four Perspectives** actually.

Perspective Analysis uses the four perspectives to help gather a better understanding of the key issues impacting on your organization.

Perspective Analysis should build upon your SWOT Analysis, and also incorporates **Thinking ****@**** Levels**** **to generate and map the appropriate challenges and opportunities to each of the four perspectives.

You need to carry out this level of analysis to build the strong foundations you'll develop your strategies on.

******Important Note:** You'll find the analysis in this section significantly easier (and more effective) if you **engage other people** in your organization to help you. If you try to do it all yourself, not only will the quality of your analysis suffer, you'll also find it more difficult to get others on board later. Use this activity as a** 'buy-in' **tool.

Perspective analysis draws upon the **same analytical skills** as SWOT to produce its outcomes. Thus, with experience, you will no longer need to conduct a separate SWOT analysis, as you'll be able to **incorporate** it within your perspective analysis.

### 4.3.1. Thinking @ Levels: A Quick Reminder

Before we jump too deep into the Perspective Analysis, it's worth reinforcing that one of the foundations of the Practical Strategy approach is that **strategy operates at different levels **within every organization.

As we discussed in the last chapter, unless you work for a massive corporation (such as IBM Worldwide), or a very small one (a local newspaper stand), it's likely that you'll have around** 3 levels** of strategy in your organization.

If you skipped this issue in chapter three, . It will greatly assist your understanding of strategy, and the analysis required in this chapter.

So …it logically follows that if strategy exists at different levels, then **of course,** so do issues.

Thus, in each of the perspectives, we **not only** have to identify the issues, we also need to be thinking about at **what level** these issues exist at.

OK, bring on the **first perspective…**

### 4.3.2. Financial Perspective Analysis

Financial issues are **everywhere** in an organization – from Level 1 (usually 'Corporate'), down through Level 2 (usually 'Business Unit' or 'Regional area') to Level 3 and beyond, (usually 'Operational').

**The key question** to answer here is "What are the Shareholder, Economic and Financial issues that help or hinder growth or organizational productivity."

We'll introduce a simple tool to help you analyze your financial perspective soon. But before that, we thought it might be worthwhile to have a look at a **few examples** of financial issues that occur at different levels in organizations. This particular organization has **3 levels.**

And remember - an 'issue' may be a **challenge **or an **opportunity.**

An organization's **Level 1** (eg. corporate) Financial issues may include:

**Share price** too low

Not enough **market share**

Tax burden

ROI/ROCE in line with market expectation

**WACC **(weighted average cost of capital) is too high

Debt to Equity out of balance

**EVA growth** above market expectation

Existing financial measures are confusing & conflicting

Poor **Corporate Profit**

The **Level 2** (eg. business unit) Financial issues that may flow down from Level 1, or stand alone at this level, might be:

******	**Lower than expected business unit **profit growth**

Unmanageable **pricing structures**

**Regional costs** out of control

Strong regional revenue growth

Internal **transfer pricing** is confusing** **

The **Level 3** (eg. operating unit) Financial issues that may flow down from Level 2, or stand alone at this level, may be:

******	**Lower** **than expected operational **revenue growth**

******	**Unmanageable product **cost overruns**

Double-handling charges

**Staff productivity** above targets

Operational **Budget** overruns

These issues are only **indicative.** Naturally, your organization will have unique financial challenges and opportunities.

And as we mentioned earlier, later in this chapter we'll introduce you to a simple **financial analysis framework** that we've used with many of our clients that you may find useful too.

And remember … **if you're reading this through for the first time**, you don't need to do anything until you get to your Personal Action Plan at the end of the chapter.

### 4.3.3. Stakeholder Perspective Analysis

Stakeholders are 'anyone who **impacts** on the desired goals of the organization, with the exception of shareholders and employees''.

We have **excluded** shareholders and employees, as their issues are covered in the 'Financial' and 'Innovation & Growth' perspectives.

**Specifically**, stakeholders are customers, competitors, government agencies, communities, partners and in some instances, suppliers.

Before you can answer this question you must decide **who** your key stakeholders are, and **what **they want from your organization, **by level.**

For example, if we take IBM worldwide…

**Note:** we have never worked with IBM, and these examples are only based on what we think might be appropriate for them.

**Level 1** (Global) stakeholders may include, International Governments & Trade Agreements, Competitors (corporate issues only - eg. Worldwide competitive response), Customers (Corporate issues only – eg. Global Branding and International accounts), Pressure Groups (Greenpeace for 'clean manufacturing'), and Global Strategic Partners.

**Level 2** (Regional – Europe) stakeholders would be National Governments, Regional Competitors, Regional Partners, Customers (eg. regional accounts and regional pricing).

**Level 3** (United Kingdom) stakeholders would be: British Government, competitors, customers (service and support), and community groups.

Now that we have defined who IBM's possible stakeholders are, lets look at some of the issues that they may need to address…

**Level 1**** **Stakeholder issues may include:

Poor **Corporate Image** / Identity (all stakeholders)

Pro-active involvement in developing trade agreements (governments)

Strong Brand Management (global customers)

Falling **Customer Profitability**** **(global customers)

Win-win relationships (strategic partners)

Building competitive advantage (global competitors)

Under-developed **Customer Value Propositions** (global customers)

**Level 2** Stakeholder issues that may flow from Level 1 (or stand alone at this level) might be:

**'Regionalizing'** corporate objectives (all stakeholders)

Poor market segmentation & targeting (regional customers)

Low **Customer Satisfaction** ratings (regional customers)

Unbalanced marketing mix (regional customers)

Regulatory **compliance** (governments)

Regional alliances (partners)

******Level 3** Stakeholder issues may include:

Low **Customer Satisfaction** ratings (customers)

Poor promotional campaigns (customers)

**Distribution** failing to deliver on time (customers)

Environmental leadership (community)

We'll cover the concepts of **Customer Value propositions** and **Stakeholder Values Propositions** soon, which when combined with the outcomes of your SWOT analysis, will help you clearly identify your specific stakeholder issues.

OK, onto the next perspective …

### 4.3.4. Process Perspective Analysis

The **effectiveness and efficiency** of your business processes are the key concerns of this perspective.

The **key question** to answer here is: To satisfy our stakeholders, in which key business processes must we **excel?**

Your processes need to be **working well** to deliver stakeholder value, which in turn leads to financial results (cause-and-effect in action). There is no good having a great marketing campaign that generates lots of leads if your phone lines are permanently engaged.

This perspective is where you'll address issues such as process management, productivity, quality, cycle times and costs.

Examples of** key organizational processes** include:

**Marketing:** Research, Pricing, Promotion and Channel Management.

**Sales:** Prospecting, Lead Management, Conversion and Relationship Building.

**Supply Chain:**** **Procurement, Logistics and Distribution

**Project Management:** Scoping, Analysis, Budgets and Change Control

**Information Management:** Assessing Business Needs and Outsourcing

**Administration:** Call Management, Invoicing and Contact Management

**Financial Management:** Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable and Debt/equity Management

**Communications**: Content, Medium, Interpretation and Interactivity

Generally, **Level 1** processes are regarded as the **overview** of the entire business process. In larger organizations, this may cover marketing, supply chain, operations etc, rather than a specific focus on one element of these processes (which would be at Level 2 or 3).

**Level 1** Process issues may include:

Critical processes misunderstood (e.g. Supply Chain)

Existing processes **too complex**** **

Strong commitment to **Continuous Improvement** and best practices (MRPII, TQM, etc)

Poor **centralized administration**

**PS.** As you work through this action plan, make sure you keep referring to the and .

# 6. BUILD YOUR MEASURES

Hours after the last familiar sign, the driver kept up a steady pace. 'We're lost, aren't we?' said the passenger. 'Yes', said the driver, 'but we're making good time, don't you think?'

- Anon.

This chapter helps you…

Define a common measurement **terminology**

Select measures that are **linked** to your strategic objectives

Understand the different types of measures

**Allocate ownership** and accountability

Set targets that motivate people

**Align your budgets** with your strategies

Let's get started …

## 6.1. What are Measures?

Earlier in this guide, we talked about the importance of **everyone** in your organization sharing a common terminology.

From our experience, **nowhere** does this apply more than in the area of measurement.

According to The Pocket Oxford dictionary, measurement means **"act or result of measuring". **Great - nice and clear!** **

However, the same dictionary also offers **over 200 words** to describe the interpretations of the word 'measure' … **without**** **even considering the number of business uses.

We like **simplicity.** So we use the verb measure (ie. to measure),

And the dictionary definition does nicely: "find extent or quantity of (thing) by comparison and measurement".

In a nutshell…

**A measure is the thing that is being measured!**

******Examples of Measures**

Table 6.1

## 6.2. What Gets Measured Gets Done, Right?

**How many times** have you used or been told the phase "what gets measured gets done". More than once we suspect!

This principle has been the **backbone **of many so-called 'performance management' systems.

There is a high degree of truth in this simple statement. However, like most things in life, if you take it merely at face value, **you'll fall short** of its true intent.

**The biggest **(and most common) **mistake**** **by organizations seeking to improve their performance through measurement … is that they fail to **link their measures to strategy. **

The measures themselves are seen as the main output, rather than the **impact**** **of the measure on the strategy it is driving.

## 6.3. Types of Measures

### 6.3.1. Strategic and Diagnostic Measures

There are **two **basic types of measure - **Strategic** and **Diagnostic.**

Strategic measures directly impact on your . These measures are the **critical few** (2 – 5 per objective) that indicate whether or not the objective is being achieved.

Diagnostic measures provide **supporting information** on why the strategic measures are trending the way they are, or why they're at the levels they are. Both these types of measures apply in each of the , and at different levels of your organization.

**Important Note:** As with most elements of the Practical Strategy approach, Strategic and Diagnostic measures differ depending on what level of the business you are developing strategy for. A Diagnostic measure at a high level in your organization (such as Cost Center Expenses) may well be a Strategic measure at a lower level in the organization.

### 6.3.2. Leading and Lagging Measures

**Lead measures** indicate what may happen in the** future**. They can be determined by hard numbers, but depending upon the measure, subjective agreement may be just as valid.

**Lag measures** tell what has happened in the** past**. These measures probably make up the majority of measures found in most of your existing reports. Lag measures are important, but they shouldn't dominate any reporting.

**Examples** of Lead of Lag Measures …

The number of **prospects** in the sales pipeline is lead measure of **revenue**.

**Website hits** is a lead measure** **on **website sales** (assuming the website has been designed to sell via the web).

The number of new **building permits** is a (three to six month) lead measure on newspaper **advertising volumes**.

Revenue, cost, net profit and gross profit are all **lag measures **of profitability.

**The Golden Rule …**

Include and report measures because they help you understand **how** your objectives are **trending** - not just because they 'affect' the objective.

### 6.4. The Importance of Targeting Measures

We have observed two distinct approaches to measurement...

### 6.4.1. Measurement for Measurement's Sake

A growing trend in many organizations is to allow technology to drive the reporting and management of measures.

Throughout the past decade have grown in popularity as most managers have come to expect **timely access** to important information.

Thousands of organizations have implemented (Enterprise Resource Planning) and projects, and using them to develop management reports that spew forth thousands of performance measures.

We have seen many performance measurement projects that have ended up **focusing on the integration** of the technology systems, and delivering **any** measure – as opposed to the **right **measures.

Problems like these are often not the fault of the technology, but with the **managers and consultants** who are driving the outcomes of the project, with their strict interpretation of 'what gets measured get done'.

In the majority of organizations that suffer from measurement for measurement's sake, their business **information systems projects** are being lead not by business managers but by technical managers.

Many of these managers, whilst having the best intentions, do not have the **analytical ability** to identify the measures that support a strategic outcome versus those that do not.

To discover whether or not your organization suffers from measurement for measurement's sake, take this **quick test …**

### 6.4.2. Take The Measurement Test …

If your organization scores **38+** then you are most likely a measurement oriented company because you can be. The likelihood of your measurement processes and systems delivering real strategic value are low.

If your company scored **between 19 & 37** then you're on the slippery slope. Some of your processes and systems need to be reviewed to ensure your measurement is targeted for strategic outcomes.

If your company scores **18 or less,**** **you have good systems and processes for allowing measurement to drive strategic outcomes. Do not rest on your laurels, measures and systems change in our dynamic world, it does take long to move up the scoring, (not a desired result!) if the focus and discipline is lost.

### 6.4.3. Measurement for Strategy's Sake

The main difference between 'measurement for measurement's sake' and 'measurement for strategy's sake' is **targeting.**

If measures are not targeted to strategic objectives, then the measures will not drive strategy. Figure 6.1 summaries the two approaches

Figure 6.1

If you're starting to think that **all the money** you've spent on your new performance measurement system has been for nothing, then take heart.

'Measurement for Measurement's Sake' and 'Measurement for Strategy's Sake' is not predominantly a technology issue.

It is an issue of **Strategy**.

**In a nutshell,** the outcome of 'Measurement for Measurement's Sake' are the measures themselves. Whereas the outcome of 'Measurement for Strategy's Sake' are measures that target strategy.

## 6.5. Choosing Your Scorecard Measures

Here's how…

### 6.5.1. You Have Zillions of Measures, Which Are The Right Ones?

Your organization may have hundreds, if not thousands, of measures that are just waiting to be given an objective they can call home.

As a **general rule**, each of your scorecards should contain around 25 measures, spread across the perspectives as follows …

Financial: 								5 Measures

Stakeholder:						5 Measures

Process:									8-10 Measures

Innovation & Growth:	5 Measures

**80%** of these should be **non-financial.**

**Note:** Your initial scorecards are likely to contain more measures than these. Don't worry too much about this – you'll reduce them over time.

OK, here's how you pick your measures …

**First of all,** get hold of as many of your organizational measures as you can. You'll find them in financial reports, board reports, production statistics, customer surveys, Profit and Loss accounts, Balance Sheets, and a whole host more.

Try to gain an initial understanding of how all your current measures fit together into a bigger picture, and where **they don't!**

Usually the **easiest place to start** selecting measures is in the Financial perspective, although the information below relates to any perspective, at any level.

Select an objective and determine the critical elements (if you have a profit objective for example, revenue and costs are critical elements) that **should be** (not can or could be) measured. **DO NOT** limit your thinking based on the measures you already use.

Work with the as you do this.

At this point some of the measures may not exist. If this is the case, select a workable substitute (which may be a qualitative measure) whilst the appropriate measure is developed (via a small project if necessary).

**Important!** **Do not** hold up the process because of a few missing measures!

Where practical, you should always involve the likely owners (managers) of measures and objectives when determining them. **Ask their opinion** about what elements contribute to the strategic objective and help them to ensure that the measures are valid and viable.

Confirm the appropriate** ** and get them to measure and comment on the measures for three months. After this period the owner should make recommendations on whether any measure need to be modified, removed or replaced.

The owner of the measure does not necessarily need to be the person with the data. The whole point of ownership of strategic components (ie. theme, objective, measure or project) is **accountability.**

Accountability means they understand the outcomes required and have the decision-making authority to **act on** actual results.

**Iteration** is the key to a successful measurement process. At monthly meetings, discuss the appropriateness and influence of your measures. Whilst they shouldn't be changed or introduced flippantly …

… neither should they be kept without a good reason.

Our experience indicates that scorecards significantly alter every 4-6 months, and measurement is usually the component that needs modifying the most.

Use common sense and discussion before committing to any changes. Make sure you **understand the impact** on your strategies.

### 6.5.2. Financial Measures

There are **three general objectives** that are typically reflected in the financial perspective of a scorecard:

Revenue Growth

Cost Management and Productivity

Asset Utilization

We identify measures for each of these objectives by answering the question:

**'What critical measures will tell me whether (or not) this **

**objective is being achieved?'**

Here are a **few examples …**

### 6.5.3. Stakeholder Measures

Perhaps **more than any other perspective**, the Stakeholder dimension of your scorecard affords opportunities to learn about and transform your organization.

Before selecting stakeholder measures, your organization must clearly identify the segments you wish to serve. You should have already done this when you developed your objectives in the last chapter.

Once again, refer to your stakeholder objectives. Ask yourself …

**'What critical measures will tell me whether (or not) this **

**objective is being achieved?'**

Here are a **few examples …**

The stakeholder perspective provides rich opportunities to obtain **qualitative information**. For example, comments and complaints by customers on satisfaction surveys may be more important than the satisfaction level they express.

The stakeholder perspective provides opportunities to **go beyond** generic customer measures, to address the value proposition offered to each targeted segment.

As previously discussed, a value proposition is the **unique combination** of product attributes, image and relationship characteristics that define an interaction with stakeholders.

Here are some **examples** of Value Proposition measures that may be used in conjunction with the measures above.

### 6.5.4. Process Measures

You will have several processes that deserve attention and measurement.

In developing your measures, you need to **focus** on the ones that you have previously developed strategic objectives for.

Refer to these objectives. Once again, ask yourself …

**'What critical measures will tell me whether (or not) this **

**objective is being achieved?'**

Here are a few examples …

### 6.5.5. Innovation & Growth Measures

The Innovation and Growth perspective focuses on the **organizational infrastructure** that is required in order to achieve objectives in the other perspectives.

As we have already discussed, there are **four common categories** for Innovation & Growth measures:

Culture

Employee Capabilities

Information Technology

Innovation

**Note:** Many of the measures in this perspective may be **qualitative** rather than quantitative.

Here are a few examples of measures …

## 6.6. Measurement: Don't go Overboard!

Some organizations with a 'control mentality' go completely over the top with measures, trying to turn their people into **robotic subcomponents** of 'the system'. Do not make this mistake!

Man **cannot **manage by measure alone!

(and if you try, you'll most likely have a **rebellion** on your hands!)

The secret to the effective use of measures is to use them to ensure people **clearly understand** what objectives their specific measures are supporting.

This helps people understand **WHY** they do what they do.

**One other important point**** **about measures …

Your organization may suffer from a 'silo mentality' where getting anything **cross-functional** done is extremely difficult.

If this is the case, you can begin to **break down barriers** between departments by allocating measures (and objectives) based on 'who would best own this?', rather than 'what division owns this?'

And as long as everyone has access to the visual representation of your scorecards (with accompanying objective and measures), it's easy to see how **accountabilities 'fit together'.**

## 6.7. Sstrrettch … Set Targets That Discourage Mediocrity

Target setting should be carried out **after** you've developed your objectives and your measures, and should clearly identify the magnitude of the challenge.

Table 6.2 - Examples of Targets

**Contrary** to popular activity, adding 5 or10% to last year's number isn't always the best way to set a target.

Take the time to understand the importance and **implications** of the objectives and measures that you're setting your targets for.

For example, if you're setting a demanding sales target in a newly-emerging and rapidly growing market segment – make sure that the other areas of your business that **support** such an ambitious outcome (eg. call center activity) have targets and budgets that are aligned.

And you've probably heard it a million times before, but just in case you haven't: Targets must be...

**S**pecific

**M**anageable

**A**chievable

**R**ealistic

**T**ime bound

### 6.7.1. How to Determine Targets

Whatever the type or nature of the target being considered, there is a fairly clear sequence of steps you should take:

Start with what is **already known**. Investigate, monitor, research - in order to establish the current situation.

If possible, check out and compare the current situation with **external criteria**** **(e.g. the comparable situation in other organizations like yours).

Decide what **amount of improvement** is practical and realistic for your situation. Be challenging and positive, rather than complacent and cautious!

Be explicit about how you **intend things to be** in the future (an improvement, of course, on the current situation!). In most cases it is possible not only to describe in words the 'desired outcome', but also to attach a numerical measure, which will indicate how the desired improvement can be seen.

Decide on an appropriate **timescale** for the improvement to happen within ("we aim to achieve this target by....")

Ensure your target is still in line with the strategies developed.

**Monitor progress** towards the target you have agreed to commit to. Keep your eye on the ball!

**Evaluate:** have we met the target? If not, why is that so? If yes, celebrate!

Remember that setting a target is only a **means to an end**. It is a way of concentrating attention, energy and resources on the measures you have decided are your priorities for improvement.

## 6.8. Case Study: What Happened at Hunger Busters?

With her confidence in the Practical Strategy approach growing, Lara set about collecting as many reports and **as much organizational measurement information** she could lay her hands on.

With the aid of a spreadsheet, she **categorised the measures** she had collected, by perspective and by strategy level. She was surprised to see the sheer volume of financial data, and the almost complete lack of qualitative information.

**Before **involving the senior management team in the issue of strategy measurement, Lara drafted what she felt would be appropriate measures for the Level 1 strategy.

She looked at all the objectives that had been developed from the work she had carried out in the last chapter 'Develop Your Strategy', and for each objective asked herself …

**'What critical measures will tell me whether (or not) this **

**objective is being achieved?'**

After developing a few draft Level 1 scorecard measures she sent each of the senior team her ideas, and called a meeting. In the meeting each of the potential measures were discussed. The management team asked themselves the following questions:

**Do we share a common Terminology?** The senior team acknowledged the confusion surrounding existing strategy terminology. They have agreed to align all terminology with the Practical Strategy Framework.

Does the proposed measure **gauge** progress in achieving the outcome required by the objective?

Can we identify possible **lead** rather than **lag** indicators?

Does the organization **have the data** required by the measure? If not what are we going to do about it?

Who should be **accountable** for reporting the measures? (In making this decision Lara reminded the team that accountability should given to the person that can comment on the influence of outcome for the month, not just the person who can access the data).

After a few hours of discussion the management team signed off the following measures for their (Note: **red measures** are lead indicators).

Throughout the meeting, the following points were discussed.

The management team knew that the Level 1 strategy would probably change over the first three months of reporting. Thus each of the **objective's 'validity'** was also discussed when the measures where being discussed. Some managers felt that EVA should be the objective, rather than shareholder value. However, the CEO felt that EVA measurement was a good way of communicating that shareholder value, as measured by the major value metrics was most appropriate.

The measures in red are the lead measures selected by the manager. They noted the **lack of lead indicators** and resolved themselves to improve the number of lead indicators over the coming months.

They discussed **diagnostic measures**. For example, the CFO wanted to track COGS % and Operating %, (for the objective - Optimize Cost & Asset Productivity) but Lara suggested that these measures could be diagnostic. The CFO had the information available to him via the performance management system, and could **comment** on these diagnostic measures via the measure Total Expenses.

She explained that commenting on Total Expenses, operating costs and COGS were part of the **feedback process** that he would need to use when explaining why expenses had met (or not met) budget.

Lara was asked by the senior management team to draft targets for the measures developed. Lara did so **in consultation** with each of the objective and measure owners, and had the targets signed off via a series of short meetings.

Lara then set about developing measures (**using the same approach**) for each of the strategies developed at the Regional and Restaurant levels.

## 6.9. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

How many measures do I need?

Measures **relate to objectives**, and generally speaking, you should have between two and five measures per objective.

So if we assume a scorecard has 12 objectives (spread across the four perspectives), you should have 24-50 measures.

I'm missing some measures, what should I do?

**Don't hold up the process**! If the measures are important, initiate a project to develop them.

What should I do if I have measures that don't relate to any objective?

Two choices …

Drop them - they're merely adding complexity, or

If you believe they're important, find out why they don't relate to an objective. Perhaps you need to **revisit **your objectives.

How do we report on Qualitative Measures without hard data?

The has to make a judgment call supported by concise commentary about the factors influencing the measure's result.

Why is commentary against measures and objectives important?

Because commentary provides **context.**

Organizations cannot be managed by numbers alone. Numbers merely provide the base for **future decisions** to be made upon.

For example - in most cases, meeting a quarterly sales target would necessitate reporting a 'on target' assessment against that particular measure. But what should be reported if the Account Manager who is responsible for meeting this particular target has just resigned?

Commentary assists decision-making, and can also provide **insights** into why decisions were made in the past.

# 7. ALIGN AND IMPLEMENT YOUR PROJECTS

"Planning is what we resort to when chance breaks down."

- Anon

The key to implementing successful strategy is reaching objectives. As we discussed in the last chapter, one of the key components of this is measurement, which addresses **ongoing** challenges and opportunities.

However, organizations also have **finite **issues that influence the outcome of objectives. Thus, in this chapter, we introduce the second key component: **Projects.**

Many projects end up out of control, overtime and over budget. Recent information from the Standish Group ()

**30% of projects are canceled before completion**

**75% of completed projects are late**

**Average cost overruns are 189%**

**Average time overruns are 222%**

This chapter helps your organization avoid joining these statistics.

**How many** separate 'stand-alone' projects are underway in your organization right now? Activities such as IT implementations, customer research, staff surveys, product development, etc?

3? …17? …26? …**more?**

You may not know the exact figure. But there's a fairly high probability that there are **many more** than there were only 2 years ago.

As organizations need to **respond more quickly** to increasing external pressures, more and more project teams are being established - with the express intention of identifying **and solving** specific issues.

**The problem is** … most organizations fail to create a **formal link** between projects and strategic objectives, and in the rare occasions that they do, often do not effectively use their project management processes.

And as a result, many organizations are **failing to deliver results** that support their strategy.

**Why? **

Because the **discipline** of establishing, managing and reporting projects is not seen as vital to the business, unless of course the project is of sufficient size, scope and impact.

Even when projects are vital, the process is usually circumvented to meet timelines and resource constraints rather than managing the project correctly each time. The attitude of **'ticking the boxes'** to get sign-off is often predominant.

In this chapter, we cover…

An **introduction** to Project Management

Why projects **fail**

The Practical Strategy approach to projects

Project **ownership**

The project **matrix** and **register**

## 7.1. Project Management 101

A project can be defined as …

" A **collection of activities** that are planned and executed to overcome a temporary problem or exploit a **finite** term opportunity."

For example: selecting and installing a new telecommunications system.

Every project, irrespective of size or complexity, has **4 distinct phases**: Initiation, Definition, Execution, and Closure.

**Phase 1: Initiation ****(Why are we doing it?)**

Is there **really** a project here? (size and complexity)

How does it support our **strategic objectives?**

Who **'owns'** the problem?

******Phase 2: Definition**** ****(What are we going to do?)**

Staking out the **Boundaries**

**Scoping** (what's covered, and just as importantly, what's not)

Setting formal objectives (we want X by Y)

Establishing budgets (best case, worst case, realistic case)

Identifying clear 'deliverables' (concrete outcomes)

Defining clear **roles & responsibilities**

**Phase 3: Execution**** ****(Doing it)**

**Co-ordination and management** of internal and external resources

'Resources' are usually time, money, physical assets and people.

And before we get into the technical aspects of the job, it's worth noting that in our opinion, 70% of a Project Manager's success is defined by their **interpersonal skills** – so you need to get on with people!

Productivity software such as project planning and spreadsheets play a helpful role in project execution - **but beware -** knowing how to drive Microsoft Project does not a Project Manager make!

**Phase 4: Closure**** ****(What have we learned?)**

Individual and organization **learning****.**

Answers two key questions: What we did we **do well**? And what could we **do better next time?**

Don't make the common mistake of missing out this stage – or you may be doomed to repeat your mistakes …

Now that we've reviewed at the basics of project management, let's take a look at why it sometimes goes wrong...

## 7.2. Why Projects Fail

There are dozens of reasons. But in our experience, the main ones are:

**Lack of senior management buy-in. **The benefits don't motivate them, or they don't understand them.

**Change of strategic direction.**** **The organization shifts, but projects don't.

**Lack of short-term wins.** Too long between milestones. 'Mini-successes' should be no more than two weeks apart.

**Too many projects going on.** Resources are being diluted.

**Too much reliance on outsourced activities.** Not enough internal involvement/commitment

**Scope Drift.** Adding to the project scope without adding time or money. If you put more in the pot, you need a bigger flame!

**Unclear and** **misunderstood definitions.**** ** Which leads to too much 'assumed knowledge'.

**Biting off more than can be chewed.** Large projects need to be phased for success.

**Recognize any?**

## 7.3. Projects: The Practical Strategy Approach

Many organizations already have some form of Project Management process in place.

If you already have a Project Management process that most people are using successfully, that's great. The purpose of this chapter is not to convince you to use the Practical Strategy approach – it's merely to ensure that your organization has an effective process that is linked to strategy.

But …if you're unhappy with your current project framework, you may wish to consider adopting our approach, which has been used by many organizations with **positive results.**

Our practical approach revolves around the use of a document we call a **Project Plan** (pretty creative don't you think? ****).

A Project Plan is created for every project, and is **continuously updated** as it evolves through its life cycle of Initiation, Definition, Execution, and Closure.

We like to **keep it simple**, with a plan that allows people the flexibility to **document the appropriate amount of detail **(larger and more risky projects tend to require a greater amount of information).

Project Plan templates should be **available to all appropriate staff** (via your information system), and should contains the following sections …** **

******PROJECT PLAN OUTLINE**

**PROJECT PURPOSE **

Definition of Problem/Opportunity

Specific Project Outcomes & Benefits

Strategic Linkages

Potential Negative Outcomes

1.4	Critical Success Factors

Assumptions

Indicative Budget & Timeframe

**RESOURCES**

Project Team Configuration (internal & external)

Other Resources (offices, pc's, etc)

**3.0****	BUDGET**

**4.0****	PROJECT MILESTONES****	**

**5.0****	CHANGE CONTROL**

A project plan is of little use if it is not linked to the four stages of project management. Which we will now address…

### 7.3.1. Phase 1: Project Initiation

At this stage, most attention is given to **Section 1** of the Project Plan: Project Purpose.

Detailing the outcomes, and more importantly, the **benefits** of the project are probably the key pieces of information the project sponsor needs. Specifics go a long way here.

One of the most critical, and least addressed, issues in many organizations is clearly **linking projects to strategic goals**. 	Think about it for a second, if the project doesn't support any existing strategies or objectives, why is it being proposed?

If a project still seems to make sense despite having no obvious link to existing strategic goals, then perhaps the organization's strategies need some work. Either way, the issue of **strategic linkage** should not be overlooked.

The project sponsor will also be keen to understand what the likely risks are if the project goes ahead. Being **honest,** and frankly stating what could go wrong adds a great deal of credibility to a project proposal. Nobody believes 'honestly, there's no downside' stories.

Finally, any **assumptions** about the project need to be clearly stated.

An example of a completed Section 1 is provided in the Hunger Busters .

Once this section has been completed, it is then passed to the **Project Sponsor**.

The Project Sponsor will either approve the project to move to the next stage, ask for more information, or kill it.

Assuming the project is **approved.** It then moves to the next stage …

### 7.3.2. Phase 2: Project Definition

These activities are usually carried out by the **Project Manager**, who may be, but isn't always, the same person that initiated the project.

**In larger projects** (such as implementing a new ERP system), which require significant resources and have a higher level of risk, it's common for organizations to engage skilled external resources – for example, a professional Project Manager.

Either way, the Project Plan needs to be fleshed out …

******Section 2: Resources**

**Project Team Configuration****. ** It is very important to clearly identify roles and responsibilities within the Project Team. The key roles, which may be filled by either internal or external people, are usually:

**Executive** **Sponsor**

Ensures the project supports organizational **strategic objectives**

Has **overall accountability** for the project** **

**Selects** the Project Manager

Agrees the project **scope**

Agrees **milestones and timeframe**

Agrees the **budget**

******Project Manager**

Develops and maintains a **clear Project Plan**

Confirms the **resources** required are available

Manages the project to the agreed milestones, and seeks to deliver the project on time, within budget, and to specification

Provides a regular **project update**** **to executive sponsor and the project team (at least once a month via the scorecard reporting framework)

May be required to provide organization-wide progress updates

**Note:** Ensure the person chosen **has the time** to manage the project and get the job done. Most good project managers are already doing too much. Do not assign projects to managers who cannot say no, even when you need that person's leadership.

Delay the project rather than inappropriately assigning accountability. When accountability is assigned to managers that already have too much on their plate, they become stressed and non-productive. Which ends up costing the organization in time, money and staff goodwill.

**Team Member**

Is clear on their **specific responsibilities** and deliverables

**Challenges thinking** where appropriate

Supports the Project Manager to the best of their abilities

May be required to play an **organizational liaison** role – ensuring that any changes will be as 'palatable' as possible to the organization.

Depending upon the complexity and size of the project, these roles may be **full or part-time,**** **or held by the same person. There may also be other roles required – such as Project Administrator.

Any **other project resources **such as office facilities, computers, etc should also be clearly identified within the Project Plan.

**Section 3: Budget**

It's fairly likely that your organization already has reasonable procedures for developing **business cases** (cost/benefit analyses, payback periods, capital expenditure, net present values, etc), so we won't go into any detail here. Your financial people should be able to help you with this.

Suffice to say that budgetary approval is often the **biggest hurdle** that projects face, and a solid business case is your best friend.

It is also often a good idea to developing a series of **Best, Medium, and Worst Case**** **financial scenarios that take project risk into account.

**Section 4: Milestones****	**

Milestones are **major events** that need to be achieved to keep the project on track.

Initially milestones maybe only loosely defined, as information on subsequent steps maybe hard to ascertain. If this is the case, attempt to establish the milestones with the **best information at the time**.

Initial milestone accuracy is largely driven by project management experience.

**Tip: **when developing milestones, actively involve other project members. Start general, then move to specifics.

One of the most **common mistakes** inexperienced project managers make is to make the time gaps between milestones too long.

Milestones are great motivational tools – they give the project team regular feedback on progress, and as such the Project Manager should make every effort to use milestone completion as a '**rallying cry'** and a celebration of partial success. It does make a difference!

The change control (section 5) procedure helps with **updating milestones** when new information supersedes the originals.

**Section 5: Change Control**

Because projects impact on objectives, it is important to ensure project milestones are kept **accurate and current**.

At least quarterly, the sponsor should double-check that the project is still directly linked and aligned to the outcomes required to enhance the objectives and measures it was set up for.

Figure 7.1 outlines the steps required to establish and manage any project.

Figure 7.1 – Project Process

### 7.3.3. Phase 3: Project Execution

Every project has **unique characteristics**, varying in size and complexity. The demands placed on your organization from moving a department between floors are very different from a national upgrade of your IT network.

Some may be scribbled on the back of a cigarette packet, while others use of more **advanced productivity tools** such as spreadsheets and project planning software (such as Microsoft Project).

At the execution stage, your Project Plan may require **updating** at periodic intervals. These updates, which should only address significant issues such as a change of scope, an increased budget, a revised assessment of strategic linkage, or an extended timeframe, should be captured within a **revised Project Plan** (eg. Version 1.1) and noted in the Change Control section.

The discipline of keeping Project Plans updated and relevant keeps your organizational thinking focused. Otherwise you may, like countless others, lose sight of the bigger picture whilst immersed in the project detail.

### 7.3.4. Phase 4: Project Closure

For many organizations, this is undoubtedly the **most neglected** project stage.

Organizations, like many individuals, seem to find it difficult to take the time to **assess their experiences** and learn from them. They are often too keen to jump at the next exciting opportunity.

Project Closure doesn't need to be a huge exercise. Simply setting the key project individuals down in a room and asking a **few simple questions** is sufficient:

What did we **learn** from this project?

What did we do** well?**

What would we do differently the **next time?**

Do we need to **change** any organizational processes?

Ensure the Project Team answer the questions from both an individual and an organizational perspective. **It's worth it.**

Regardless of which project management methodology approach you use, there is one **fundamental issue** you cannot ignore…

## 7.4. Linking Projects to Strategy: The Matrix

… Go Keanu!

No, not that matrix!

As mentioned earlier, if projects are **not linked to strategies**, there is a real risk that resources can be deployed in non-strategic areas.

… which is a **waste **of time, money and value.

To link your projects, you must answer this **key question…**

' What strategic objective (or objectives) will this project enhance?'

Initially, any organization adopting the Practical Strategy approach needs to prioritize the projects it currently has under way. We recommend a simple but effective method.

Simply list all of the objectives from each of your strategies, one after the other (a spreadsheet is best – see Figure 7.2). Then assess each project by the strategic impact it has against each objective.

Some of your projects may no strategic impact, which means they are not strategically aligned. If this is the case there can only be one of two possibilities.

The project is not **strategically valid** and thus should be cancelled

Your strategies are lacking in certain areas and need to be **enhanced **to reflect reality.

The project matrix is an easy and powerful decision-making tool. We recommend that each **new project** be added to the matrix (and project register) and the completed ones removed.

As a minimum, at the start of each financial year this process should be carried out, as project expenditure, generally, is a **large but under-calculated** portion of total budgeted spend each year.

Here is an **example **of a project matrix…

Figure 7.2

## 7.5. The Project Register

**Remember** at the very beginning of this chapter when we asked 'How many projects are underway in your organization right now?'

How accurate do you think your estimate was? Do you think you were close? Is there **anyone** in your organization that could accurately answer the question?

Personally, we're not big fans of creating bureaucratic frameworks at the drop of a hat, but we've found that many organizations have benefited from creating and **allocating responsibility** for a simple **Project Register.**** **A centrally controlled spreadsheet is usually the best idea.

Which, as a minimum, has column headings detailing; Project Number, Project Name, Project Stage (Initiation, Definition, Execution, Closed), Project Owner, Summary Description, Strategic Linkages, Budget, Start Date and Completion Date.

The **key benefits** of such an approach are:

The knows what projects need to be commented on within the monthly reporting framework.

The Project Owners know that their efforts and progress are subject to **regular strategic scrutiny.**

The senior management team have a much better understanding of where, why and how organizational **resources are being used** (or misused).

Information needed for the **annual budgeting process** (planned capital expenditure, etc) is more accurate and easier to access.

If project spend is a large element of your organization's annual expenditure, we strongly recommend you adopt this approach. If used in conjunction with the Project Matrix, it will **significantly improve** your organization's visibility and use of resources.

## 7.6. Case Study: What Happened at Hunger Busters?

Lara has discussed the benefits of a **more effective approach** to allocating project resources within Hunger Busters with the senior management team.

She highlighted that last year, 15% percent ($68M) of the annual budget was spent on one-off activities that the senior team have historically has very little visibility on.

She argued a **strong case**, and has been given approval to work with the Operations Manager to implement the Practical Strategy Project framework organization-wide. All **significant** projects are now to be assessed and implemented using this approach.

Lara's first step was to create and then ensure that all existing significant projects were captured within the . Lara appointed Charlie Dempsey, one of Hunger Busters management accountants (who was keen to play a more strategic role), as the organization's project administrator – a part-time activity.

Hunger Busters has suffered from a **poor telephone system** for the last 18 months. With investment required elsewhere in the past, they decided hat it is time to look seriously at a new or upgraded system.

Lara believed that she should put her money where her mouth is, and volunteered to be the Given the likely level of budgetary approval required, the CEO was the Project Sponsor.

Lara **drafted Section One** (Project Purpose) of the and submitted it to the CEO for approval to move to the next stage.

This is what the completed Section 1 looked like …

**Hunger Busters PROJECT PLAN**

**Section 1: Project Purpose**

**1.1. Definition of Problem/Opportunity**** **

Hunger Busters Australia's current phone system is **substandard** for the size and complexity of the organization. Head Office in Sydney is most affected, however all Australian area offices utilize the current standard Telstra GB143 system. At Sydney and Melbourne voice messages are often lost and staff cannot always dial out due to a **shortage of lines.** Further, Hunger Busters Internet connection speed is limited to 33Kps.

******1.2. Specific Project Outcomes & Benefits**

This project will look at the purchase of a **new/upgraded service** for all phones (fixed and mobile) within Australia. 600 (400 fixed, 200 mobile) phones will be affected, with voice and Internet services also being considered.

**Benefits**

Improved staff productivity

Improved customer service

Lower 'per call' costs, due to move to integrated call/data package.

**1.3. Strategic Linkages**

This project supports these current strategies and objectives:

**Corporate Strategy **

Optimize Productivity

Listen and Respond to the Customer

Improve all levels of Communication

**Restaurant and Area Strategies**

Enhance Communication

**Information Technology Strategy**

Deliver Effective Telecommunication Services

**Marketing Strategy**

Listen and React to Customer's Needs

**1.3. Potential Negative Outcomes**

The cost of maintaining and running the telephone system may increase due to more phone time access. However we expect to be able to negotiate much lower per call charges and greater service for employees and customers

**1.4. Critical Success Factors **

A telecommunications service provider that can deliver what they promise. There is a lot of new technology in the marketplace currently and the initial feedback is to be mindful of companies that promise the world, but deliver little. To counter this we will only purchase from a company that can show us an installed operating solution, with a happy customer.

Involvement of at least one person from I.T. who is working on the current phone system.

**1.5.****	 Assumptions**

That the Board will approve the CAPEX, projected spend and NPV calculations

**1.6. Indicative Budget & Timeframe**

At this stage, it is believed that the project will cost around $800K, and take just over 9 months to complete (national rollout). These figures will be confirmed should this project be approved to move to the definition stage.

Lara submitted Section 1 to the Project Sponsor, the CEO, who after **clarifying a few points** about potential team members, approved the project to move to the next stage – Project Definition.

As Project Owner, Lara now **completed Sections 2-5 …**

******Section 2: Resources**

**2.1. Team Configuration **

The following 3 members comprise the Project Team:

**2.2. Communications**

Project communication will be managed as follows:

Fortnightly Project Update, notes to be sent to Executive Sponsor

2. Progress updated monthly via Scorecard

**Section 3: Budget**

**3.1 CAPEX and NPV**

The Net Present Value (NPV) for the project will be **slightly negative,** as the project will not dramatically affect inward cash flow. However, we have projected a slight increase in revenues due to greater customer loyalty and we expect a **positive impact** on the cost per call rate and current maintenance bill.

The NPV (using a discount rate of 10%) was -$52,000, over 5 years. This assumes a 30% increase in the utilization of phones. If the NPV is run for the same number of existing phones (350), over five years the NPV is positive, ($ 66,000) due to expected savings in maintenance.

Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) required

$ 100, 000 in new Phones

$ 750,000 new PABX

$ 50,000 new line installation

$ 125,000 new wiring, and other services

**Total: AUD $ 1.025 Million **

**Scenarios**

**Spend**

Best Case $ 850,000

Worst Case $ 1,500,000

**Most Likely $ 1,025,000**

**Project NPV **

Best Case (@ 9%) 	$ - 0

Worst Case (@11.5%) 	$ -230,000

**Most Likely (@10%) ****	$-52,000**

The risk assessment showed a normal discount factor of 10%, Time Risk (not completing the project on time, .3), Resource Risk (risk that risks will not be available when required, .35), Strategic Risk (risk of project non performance on business outcomes, .2), Financial Risk (risk that the budget will not be enough, .15)

Lara ran the scenarios increasing the **resource and time risk** and decreasing the Strategic risk. The increase in time risk reflected the comment by a certain customer visited that the Telco Company had a limited resource for larger workloads.

Due to strong growth and expansion plans at Hunger Busters, she also felt it prudent to **increase the Resource Risk** for worst-case thinking. On the positive side Lara lowered the financial risk as she had secured the budget and the likelihood of budget overruns was low. The Telco customer visits confirmed this.

******Section 4: Milestones**

The following milestones will be achieved during the Project.

**Section 5: Change Control**

Nil Changes as at 01/02/2002

This project plan was **approved** by the CEO, and entered into the **project register.** Telstra's new GB5000 PABX, with mobile and ISDN (min 256k – 1Meg max) solution was installed at the Sydney office in the last week of May.

For a couple of months the system displayed several bugs that some managers found frustrating. These managers provided **direct feedback** against the project via the **scorecard reporting framework**, resulting in Telstra being engaged to fix the issues within the test timeframe.

The remaining milestones were delivered ahead of schedule, and the project was completed on the first of December 2002, with the Project Leader (Lara) and the CEO very happy with the project. With total spend at $958,000; the project was regarded as a success.

**Upon completion,** the project was removed from the scorecard and updated as 'complete' within the project register. In order to ensure ongoing effectiveness, **two new measures** were added to the strategic objective 'Deliver Effective Telecommunication Services' within the IT strategy: These were 'Average internet Connection Speed' and 'Number of Internal Communication Complaints'.

# 8. REPORT & COMMUNICATE

Once you've made some progress with the Practical Strategy approach, you'll realize that you have lots of **different bits of information** all over your organization - strategies, scorecards, projects and measures.

The managers in your organization need to report progress against these . They also need **easy access** to this information and be able **make sense**** **of it all.

For most organizations (except the very small), this will mean investment in a **technology solution** that supports their strategic framework.

Choosing and implementing a technology solution to support the Practical Strategy approach is a **critically important**** **activity.

The information in this chapter helps you make **informed technology decisions** for your organization.

## 8.1. Why Do You Need Technology?

Unless you are a **very** small organization, it's likely that you're going to need some sort of scorecard technology solution. An effective technology solution helps **in many ways:**

Communicating your **strategic message** – through personal desktop systems that reinforce the business direction.

Providing a clear and accessible 'information framework' for **management discussion** and debate.

Increases **speed** of shared understanding through agreed (and day-to-day use of) terminology.

Streamlines and simplifies **management reporting** – each manager can quickly and regularly update their areas of responsibility.

Clearly defining **accountability** for objectives and measures.

Providing **'fingertip access'**** **to key performance measures for decision-makers.

Allowing powerful **information-search** tools for those with integrated systems hooked into, or included with, their scorecard application (more on this soon…)

You may wish to attempt to roll out your scorecard framework via **desktop productivity tools** such as spreadsheets and email.

And the subsequent technical difficulties may result in people **abandoning **the scorecard concept because of the hassle of working 'the system'.

Which is why we **strongly recommend**** **you consider buying a software application specifically designed for the task at hand.

But before you spend any cash, you need to be **armed** with the right information...

## 8.2. When Should You Start thinking About Technology?

A key issue surrounding a scorecard implementation is when to consider purchasing technology.

The main factors that you need to consider are:

**Are you developing one scorecard or a scorecard process?***** ***Many companies have a corporate scorecard that they roll out to the executive team but no further. A full Practical Strategy implementation runs from the boardroom to the washroom, across multiple strategies and multiple levels within the organization. Within such an environment, where **at least 30 people** are required to contribute to multiple strategies, technology will be a critical success factor in providing a practical solution.

**Pilot versus Full rollout. ** It isn't necessary to buy a full organization-wide solution on day one. A 'pilot' involving key business managers (try to involve at least **two organizational levels**) will allow you to assess the technology fit, process changes and a whole host of other practical issues that need to be considered before the solution goes organization-wide.

**Budgets & Cash flow.** As a general rule, Technology = Money. In this case, anywhere from a couple of thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands. If you're in the process of pulling budgets together while you're reading this, ensure you have enough budget for at least a pilot technology project. **Even better** is to earmark additional budget that allows you to continue to expand your technology solution should you decide that your pilot was a success*. *

**Existing Technology*****. *** If you have an existing that doesn't have an integrated scorecard module, then the issue could be whether or not you want a scorecard solution that is **separate**** **from your existing system. We'll come back to this issue in more detail later in this chapter.

**Technology decisions made further up the corporate chain*****.*** If you work for a large multi-national, your information systems decisions may be made at the corporate level, or perhaps even in another geographic region. Your biggest issue with selecting and implementing a scorecard system may be convincing the bureaucracy above to run with a 'non-standard' application.

Far be it from us to recommend **bending company policy**, but a stand-alone system that doesn't need to integrate with your other systems and can **sneaked under the radar** might be your best option.

**Manager's Attitude to Technology*****. *** Perhaps one of hardest issues to address is the approach by managers (especially executives) towards using new technology. Some managers will grasp the strength and flexibility of a technology solution, where as others will need a lot of help.

Generally, we recommended that you budget for a **pilot technology solution,** with the intention to spend more if it works for you. Be wary of vendors that recommend you spend lots of money before you've addressed the issues above.

## 8.3. What's The Best Solution For Your Organization?

First, a little bit of background …

### 8.3.1. The First Scorecard Technology Solution

In the early nineties, wrote in a series of Harvard Business Review articles about the Balanced Scorecard, focusing heavily on the measures that could deliver success within the business. They educated us on the benefits of the and the lag and lead measures within these perspectives.

In particular, as David Norton developed his consulting practices (Renaissance World-wide) in this area, he appeared to pick up on how his clients tended to use this process to **drive strategic change***, *not just measurement and accountability change.

However it wasn't till Kaplan and Norton's in 1997, that the wider market got to really understand that the scorecard process was a lot more about strategy rather than just about measurement.

During 1997, Renaissance World-wide realized that to truly add value to medium-large organizations, the scorecard process should be **automated.**** ** So they searched for, and found, a technology partner.

In 1998, Renaissance World-wide and Gentia Software developed and released a software product - **The Renaissance Balanced Scorecard**.

This product didn't take long to generate a fair amount on noise in the then, market. At that time Gentia Software had the scorecard and a customizable solution to offer clients.

They and their competitors quickly realized that from a technology standpoint, the scorecard was **just another** software application.

Thus, the applications age was born, spearheaded by the scorecard application.

The scorecard **quickly gathered momentum** and many of Gentia's competitors looked to include a scorecard in their database solution, because the market demand was beginning to grow, and Gentia was carving out a niche for itself that threatened to be very profitable.

The trouble for the other vendors was that Renaissance had signed an exclusive deal with Gentia Software for two years. However, with the amount of information on the scorecard process in general circulation, it wasn't hard for other database vendors to develop/copy/buy a product that reflected the** '****public understanding'**** **of a scorecard.

The key difference at this time was that "The Renaissance Balanced Scorecard" was a product produced for Strategy focused scorecards, whereas many of the competing products were **measurement focused** and reflected more of the database vendors core technology strengths, rather than customer strategy communication and feedback needs.

And that concludes our **short history** of the very first commercial scorecard technology solution.

### 8.3.2. Your Software Options

There are many 'systems' that help manage an organization: Balanced Scorecard, Value-Based Management, Economic Value Added, Activity-based Costing, etc …

(Apologies for the **festival of jargon**** ****–** almost over!)

… collectively these are often referred to as 'Enterprise Management Systems'.

And initially, there were only a few software vendors in this category.

The next few pages categorize the different 'types' of scorecard software vendors. There are many 'sub-segments' in this field, but, for the sake of clarity, we have **categorized** them into two distinct camps.

The first one is …

**The ****ERP**** ****Vendors**

The vendors offering a scorecard solution are:

These companies are using the applications that work with their ERP systems as the foundation for their scorecard applications. This approach addresses some of the common integration issues that have plagued many scorecard projects to date.

While many industry observers initially doubted the ERP vendors' ability to be effective in this area, it appears that they're doing pretty well.

**But what do you do** if you don't have an ERP system that provides a scorecard option? (or you do, but you don't like their offering?)

******The ****Niche**** ****Providers**

The products that these organizations offer have come mostly from a background where the core technology has been used for analytical applications.

The key advantage of these products is that they are **easier to integrate** with other systems, and in many cases offer a simpler 'stand-alone' scorecard solution.

The **players in this area** include …

Table 8.1 – Selection of Niche Scorecard Software Vendors

You may at this stage be wondering which software solution we recommend. The short answer is: **we don't. **

Technology changes too fast. Whatever we write will be out of date in a few months, and in the end, **only you** know what the best solution for your organization will be.

However, if you're looking for a **more detailed independent view** (perhaps you've decided not to engage an external consultant for example), you can contact

What technology you already **have in place**

How much information you want to pull from your **other systems**

Your **budget** (a.k.a. Senior Management Commitment)

How many people will use the system (not all solutions are easily scalable)

How much you **trust** the vendor/implementer to deliver on their promises (based on visits to other vendor customers)

### 8.3.3. Scorecard Technology: A Short History

If you'd like **more detail** about scorecard technology issues - this section is for you.

If you're still developing your knowledge in this area, we strongly recommend that you ask your senior technical person to read it too. Then schedule a meeting for a few hours to share your understanding of what this means for your organization.

Or you can **read this later,** and skip to

Organizations prior the nineteen eighties existed around a **strict hierarchical structure**. Executive, middle and line management all had strongly defined roles and responsibilities.

This type of organizational structure was invented by the ancient Chinese army to better manage its fighting capability, and has **hardly changed** in the last four thousand years.

The information systems put into place during this time reflected this management structure and tended to be **rigid and hierarchical** as well, with **little communication** between the different systems.

These systems were based around the first generation mainframe based executive information systems for the top-level management with MIS databases and query tools for the middle management layer.

Process:									8-10 Measures

Innovation & Growth:	5 Measures

**80%** of these should be **non-financial.**

**Note:** Your initial scorecards are likely to contain more measures than these. Don't worry too much about this – you'll reduce them over time.

OK, here's how you pick your measures …

**First of all,** get hold of as many of your organizational measures as you can. You'll find them in financial reports, board reports, production statistics, customer surveys, Profit and Loss accounts, Balance Sheets, and a whole host more.

Try to gain an initial understanding of how all your current measures fit together into a bigger picture, and where **they don't!**

Usually the **easiest place to start** selecting measures is in the Financial perspective, although the information below relates to any perspective, at any level.

Select an objective and determine the critical elements (if you have a profit objective for example, revenue and costs are critical elements) that **should be** (not can or could be) measured. **DO NOT** limit your thinking based on the measures you already use.

Work with the as you do this.

At this point some of the measures may not exist. If this is the case, select a workable substitute (which may be a qualitative measure) whilst the appropriate measure is developed (via a small project if necessary).

**Important!** **Do not** hold up the process because of a few missing measures!

Where practical, you should always involve the likely owners (managers) of measures and objectives when determining them. **Ask their opinion** about what elements contribute to the strategic objective and help them to ensure that the measures are valid and viable.

Confirm the appropriate** ** and get them to measure and comment on the measures for three months. After this period the owner should make recommendations on whether any measure need to be modified, removed or replaced.

The owner of the measure does not necessarily need to be the person with the data. The whole point of ownership of strategic components (ie. theme, objective, measure or project) is **accountability.**

Accountability means they understand the outcomes required and have the decision-making authority to **act on** actual results.

**Iteration** is the key to a successful measurement process. At monthly meetings, discuss the appropriateness and influence of your measures. Whilst they shouldn't be changed or introduced flippantly …

… neither should they be kept without a good reason.

Our experience indicates that scorecards significantly alter every 4-6 months, and measurement is usually the component that needs modifying the most.

Use common sense and discussion before committing to any changes. Make sure you **understand the impact** on your strategies.

### 6.5.2. Financial Measures

There are **three general objectives** that are typically reflected in the financial perspective of a scorecard:

Revenue Growth

Cost Management and Productivity

Asset Utilization

We identify measures for each of these objectives by answering the question:

**'What critical measures will tell me whether (or not) this **

**objective is being achieved?'**

Here are a **few examples …**

### 6.5.3. Stakeholder Measures

Perhaps **more than any other perspective**, the Stakeholder dimension of your scorecard affords opportunities to learn about and transform your organization.

Before selecting stakeholder measures, your organization must clearly identify the segments you wish to serve. You should have already done this when you developed your objectives in the last chapter.

Once again, refer to your stakeholder objectives. Ask yourself …

**'What critical measures will tell me whether (or not) this **

**objective is being achieved?'**

Here are a **few examples …**

The stakeholder perspective provides rich opportunities to obtain **qualitative information**. For example, comments and complaints by customers on satisfaction surveys may be more important than the satisfaction level they express.

The stakeholder perspective provides opportunities to **go beyond** generic customer measures, to address the value proposition offered to each targeted segment.

As previously discussed, a value proposition is the **unique combination** of product attributes, image and relationship characteristics that define an interaction with stakeholders.

Here are some **examples** of Value Proposition measures that may be used in conjunction with the measures above.

### 6.5.4. Process Measures

You will have several processes that deserve attention and measurement.

In developing your measures, you need to **focus** on the ones that you have previously developed strategic objectives for.

Refer to these objectives. Once again, ask yourself …

**'What critical measures will tell me whether (or not) this **

**objective is being achieved?'**

Here are a few examples …

### 6.5.5. Innovation & Growth Measures

The Innovation and Growth perspective focuses on the **organizational infrastructure** that is required in order to achieve objectives in the other perspectives.

As we have already discussed, there are **four common categories** for Innovation & Growth measures:

Culture

Employee Capabilities

Information Technology

Innovation

**Note:** Many of the measures in this perspective may be **qualitative** rather than quantitative.

Here are a few examples of measures …

## 6.6. Measurement: Don't go Overboard!

Some organizations with a 'control mentality' go completely over the top with measures, trying to turn their people into **robotic subcomponents** of 'the system'. Do not make this mistake!

Man **cannot **manage by measure alone!

(and if you try, you'll most likely have a **rebellion** on your hands!)

The secret to the effective use of measures is to use them to ensure people **clearly understand** what objectives their specific measures are supporting.

This helps people understand **WHY** they do what they do.

**One other important point**** **about measures …

Your organization may suffer from a 'silo mentality' where getting anything **cross-functional** done is extremely difficult.

If this is the case, you can begin to **break down barriers** between departments by allocating measures (and objectives) based on 'who would best own this?', rather than 'what division owns this?'

And as long as everyone has access to the visual representation of your scorecards (with accompanying objective and measures), it's easy to see how **accountabilities 'fit together'.**

## 6.7. Sstrrettch … Set Targets That Discourage Mediocrity

Target setting should be carried out **after** you've developed your objectives and your measures, and should clearly identify the magnitude of the challenge.

Table 6.2 - Examples of Targets

**Contrary** to popular activity, adding 5 or10% to last year's number isn't always the best way to set a target.

Take the time to understand the importance and **implications** of the objectives and measures that you're setting your targets for.

For example, if you're setting a demanding sales target in a newly-emerging and rapidly growing market segment – make sure that the other areas of your business that **support** such an ambitious outcome (eg. call center activity) have targets and budgets that are aligned.

And you've probably heard it a million times before, but just in case you haven't: Targets must be...

**S**pecific

**M**anageable

**A**chievable

**R**ealistic

**T**ime bound

### 6.7.1. How to Determine Targets

Whatever the type or nature of the target being considered, there is a fairly clear sequence of steps you should take:

Start with what is **already known**. Investigate, monitor, research - in order to establish the current situation.

If possible, check out and compare the current situation with **external criteria**** **(e.g. the comparable situation in other organizations like yours).

Decide what **amount of improvement** is practical and realistic for your situation. Be challenging and positive, rather than complacent and cautious!

Be explicit about how you **intend things to be** in the future (an improvement, of course, on the current situation!). In most cases it is possible not only to describe in words the 'desired outcome', but also to attach a numerical measure, which will indicate how the desired improvement can be seen.

Decide on an appropriate **timescale** for the improvement to happen within ("we aim to achieve this target by....")

Ensure your target is still in line with the strategies developed.

**Monitor progress** towards the target you have agreed to commit to. Keep your eye on the ball!

**Evaluate:** have we met the target? If not, why is that so? If yes, celebrate!

Remember that setting a target is only a **means to an end**. It is a way of concentrating attention, energy and resources on the measures you have decided are your priorities for improvement.

## 6.8. Case Study: What Happened at Hunger Busters?

With her confidence in the Practical Strategy approach growing, Lara set about collecting as many reports and **as much organizational measurement information** she could lay her hands on.

With the aid of a spreadsheet, she **categorised the measures** she had collected, by perspective and by strategy level. She was surprised to see the sheer volume of financial data, and the almost complete lack of qualitative information.

**Before **involving the senior management team in the issue of strategy measurement, Lara drafted what she felt would be appropriate measures for the Level 1 strategy.

She looked at all the objectives that had been developed from the work she had carried out in the last chapter 'Develop Your Strategy', and for each objective asked herself …

**'What critical measures will tell me whether (or not) this **

**objective is being achieved?'**

After developing a few draft Level 1 scorecard measures she sent each of the senior team her ideas, and called a meeting. In the meeting each of the potential measures were discussed. The management team asked themselves the following questions:

**Do we share a common Terminology?** The senior team acknowledged the confusion surrounding existing strategy terminology. They have agreed to align all terminology with the Practical Strategy Framework.

Does the proposed measure **gauge** progress in achieving the outcome required by the objective?

Can we identify possible **lead** rather than **lag** indicators?

Does the organization **have the data** required by the measure? If not what are we going to do about it?

Who should be **accountable** for reporting the measures? (In making this decision Lara reminded the team that accountability should given to the person that can comment on the influence of outcome for the month, not just the person who can access the data).

After a few hours of discussion the management team signed off the following measures for their (Note: **red measures** are lead indicators).

Throughout the meeting, the following points were discussed.

The management team knew that the Level 1 strategy would probably change over the first three months of reporting. Thus each of the **objective's 'validity'** was also discussed when the measures where being discussed. Some managers felt that EVA should be the objective, rather than shareholder value. However, the CEO felt that EVA measurement was a good way of communicating that shareholder value, as measured by the major value metrics was most appropriate.

The measures in red are the lead measures selected by the manager. They noted the **lack of lead indicators** and resolved themselves to improve the number of lead indicators over the coming months.

They discussed **diagnostic measures**. For example, the CFO wanted to track COGS % and Operating %, (for the objective - Optimize Cost & Asset Productivity) but Lara suggested that these measures could be diagnostic. The CFO had the information available to him via the performance management system, and could **comment** on these diagnostic measures via the measure Total Expenses.

She explained that commenting on Total Expenses, operating costs and COGS were part of the **feedback process** that he would need to use when explaining why expenses had met (or not met) budget.

Lara was asked by the senior management team to draft targets for the measures developed. Lara did so **in consultation** with each of the objective and measure owners, and had the targets signed off via a series of short meetings.

Lara then set about developing measures (**using the same approach**) for each of the strategies developed at the Regional and Restaurant levels.

## 6.9. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

How many measures do I need?

Measures **relate to objectives**, and generally speaking, you should have between two and five measures per objective.

So if we assume a scorecard has 12 objectives (spread across the four perspectives), you should have 24-50 measures.

I'm missing some measures, what should I do?

**Don't hold up the process**! If the measures are important, initiate a project to develop them.

What should I do if I have measures that don't relate to any objective?

Two choices …

Drop them - they're merely adding complexity, or

If you believe they're important, find out why they don't relate to an objective. Perhaps you need to **revisit **your objectives.

How do we report on Qualitative Measures without hard data?

The has to make a judgment call supported by concise commentary about the factors influencing the measure's result.

Why is commentary against measures and objectives important?

Because commentary provides **context.**

Organizations cannot be managed by numbers alone. Numbers merely provide the base for **future decisions** to be made upon.

For example - in most cases, meeting a quarterly sales target would necessitate reporting a 'on target' assessment against that particular measure. But what should be reported if the Account Manager who is responsible for meeting this particular target has just resigned?

Commentary assists decision-making, and can also provide **insights** into why decisions were made in the past.

# 7. ALIGN AND IMPLEMENT YOUR PROJECTS

"Planning is what we resort to when chance breaks down."

- Anon

The key to implementing successful strategy is reaching objectives. As we discussed in the last chapter, one of the key components of this is measurement, which addresses **ongoing** challenges and opportunities.

However, organizations also have **finite **issues that influence the outcome of objectives. Thus, in this chapter, we introduce the second key component: **Projects.**

Many projects end up out of control, overtime and over budget. Recent information from the Standish Group ()

**30% of projects are canceled before completion**

**75% of completed projects are late**

**Average cost overruns are 189%**

**Average time overruns are 222%**

This chapter helps your organization avoid joining these statistics.

**How many** separate 'stand-alone' projects are underway in your organization right now? Activities such as IT implementations, customer research, staff surveys, product development, etc?

3? …17? …26? …**more?**

You may not know the exact figure. But there's a fairly high probability that there are **many more** than there were only 2 years ago.

As organizations need to **respond more quickly** to increasing external pressures, more and more project teams are being established - with the express intention of identifying **and solving** specific issues.

**The problem is** … most organizations fail to create a **formal link** between projects and strategic objectives, and in the rare occasions that they do, often do not effectively use their project management processes.

And as a result, many organizations are **failing to deliver results** that support their strategy.

**Why? **

Because the **discipline** of establishing, managing and reporting projects is not seen as vital to the business, unless of course the project is of sufficient size, scope and impact.

Even when projects are vital, the process is usually circumvented to meet timelines and resource constraints rather than managing the project correctly each time. The attitude of **'ticking the boxes'** to get sign-off is often predominant.

In this chapter, we cover…

An **introduction** to Project Management

Why projects **fail**

The Practical Strategy approach to projects

Project **ownership**

The project **matrix** and **register**

## 7.1. Project Management 101

A project can be defined as …

" A **collection of activities** that are planned and executed to overcome a temporary problem or exploit a **finite** term opportunity."

For example: selecting and installing a new telecommunications system.

Every project, irrespective of size or complexity, has **4 distinct phases**: Initiation, Definition, Execution, and Closure.

**Phase 1: Initiation ****(Why are we doing it?)**

Is there **really** a project here? (size and complexity)

How does it support our **strategic objectives?**

Who **'owns'** the problem?

******Phase 2: Definition**** ****(What are we going to do?)**

Staking out the **Boundaries**

**Scoping** (what's covered, and just as importantly, what's not)

Setting formal objectives (we want X by Y)

Establishing budgets (best case, worst case, realistic case)

Identifying clear 'deliverables' (concrete outcomes)

Defining clear **roles & responsibilities**

**Phase 3: Execution**** ****(Doing it)**

**Co-ordination and management** of internal and external resources

'Resources' are usually time, money, physical assets and people.

And before we get into the technical aspects of the job, it's worth noting that in our opinion, 70% of a Project Manager's success is defined by their **interpersonal skills** – so you need to get on with people!

Productivity software such as project planning and spreadsheets play a helpful role in project execution - **but beware -** knowing how to drive Microsoft Project does not a Project Manager make!

**Phase 4: Closure**** ****(What have we learned?)**

Individual and organization **learning****.**

Answers two key questions: What we did we **do well**? And what could we **do better next time?**

Don't make the common mistake of missing out this stage – or you may be doomed to repeat your mistakes …

Now that we've reviewed at the basics of project management, let's take a look at why it sometimes goes wrong...

## 7.2. Why Projects Fail

There are dozens of reasons. But in our experience, the main ones are:

**Lack of senior management buy-in. **The benefits don't motivate them, or they don't understand them.

**Change of strategic direction.**** **The organization shifts, but projects don't.

**Lack of short-term wins.** Too long between milestones. 'Mini-successes' should be no more than two weeks apart.

**Too many projects going on.** Resources are being diluted.

**Too much reliance on outsourced activities.** Not enough internal involvement/commitment

**Scope Drift.** Adding to the project scope without adding time or money. If you put more in the pot, you need a bigger flame!

**Unclear and** **misunderstood definitions.**** ** Which leads to too much 'assumed knowledge'.

**Biting off more than can be chewed.** Large projects need to be phased for success.

**Recognize any?**

## 7.3. Projects: The Practical Strategy Approach

Many organizations already have some form of Project Management process in place.

If you already have a Project Management process that most people are using successfully, that's great. The purpose of this chapter is not to convince you to use the Practical Strategy approach – it's merely to ensure that your organization has an effective process that is linked to strategy.

But …if you're unhappy with your current project framework, you may wish to consider adopting our approach, which has been used by many organizations with **positive results.**

Our practical approach revolves around the use of a document we call a **Project Plan** (pretty creative don't you think? ****).

A Project Plan is created for every project, and is **continuously updated** as it evolves through its life cycle of Initiation, Definition, Execution, and Closure.

We like to **keep it simple**, with a plan that allows people the flexibility to **document the appropriate amount of detail **(larger and more risky projects tend to require a greater amount of information).

Project Plan templates should be **available to all appropriate staff** (via your information system), and should contains the following sections …** **

******PROJECT PLAN OUTLINE**

**PROJECT PURPOSE **

Definition of Problem/Opportunity

Specific Project Outcomes & Benefits

Strategic Linkages

Potential Negative Outcomes

1.4	Critical Success Factors

Assumptions

Indicative Budget & Timeframe

**RESOURCES**

Project Team Configuration (internal & external)

Other Resources (offices, pc's, etc)

**3.0****	BUDGET**

**4.0****	PROJECT MILESTONES****	**

**5.0****	CHANGE CONTROL**

A project plan is of little use if it is not linked to the four stages of project management. Which we will now address…

### 7.3.1. Phase 1: Project Initiation

At this stage, most attention is given to **Section 1** of the Project Plan: Project Purpose.

Detailing the outcomes, and more importantly, the **benefits** of the project are probably the key pieces of information the project sponsor needs. Specifics go a long way here.

One of the most critical, and least addressed, issues in many organizations is clearly **linking projects to strategic goals**. 	Think about it for a second, if the project doesn't support any existing strategies or objectives, why is it being proposed?

If a project still seems to make sense despite having no obvious link to existing strategic goals, then perhaps the organization's strategies need some work. Either way, the issue of **strategic linkage** should not be overlooked.

The project sponsor will also be keen to understand what the likely risks are if the project goes ahead. Being **honest,** and frankly stating what could go wrong adds a great deal of credibility to a project proposal. Nobody believes 'honestly, there's no downside' stories.

Finally, any **assumptions** about the project need to be clearly stated.

An example of a completed Section 1 is provided in the Hunger Busters .

Once this section has been completed, it is then passed to the **Project Sponsor**.

The Project Sponsor will either approve the project to move to the next stage, ask for more information, or kill it.

Assuming the project is **approved.** It then moves to the next stage …

### 7.3.2. Phase 2: Project Definition

These activities are usually carried out by the **Project Manager**, who may be, but isn't always, the same person that initiated the project.

**In larger projects** (such as implementing a new ERP system), which require significant resources and have a higher level of risk, it's common for organizations to engage skilled external resources – for example, a professional Project Manager.

Either way, the Project Plan needs to be fleshed out …

******Section 2: Resources**

**Project Team Configuration****. ** It is very important to clearly identify roles and responsibilities within the Project Team. The key roles, which may be filled by either internal or external people, are usually:

**Executive** **Sponsor**

Ensures the project supports organizational **strategic objectives**

Has **overall accountability** for the project** **

**Selects** the Project Manager

Agrees the project **scope**

Agrees **milestones and timeframe**

Agrees the **budget**

******Project Manager**

Develops and maintains a **clear Project Plan**

Confirms the **resources** required are available

Manages the project to the agreed milestones, and seeks to deliver the project on time, within budget, and to specification

Provides a regular **project update**** **to executive sponsor and the project team (at least once a month via the scorecard reporting framework)

May be required to provide organization-wide progress updates

**Note:** Ensure the person chosen **has the time** to manage the project and get the job done. Most good project managers are already doing too much. Do not assign projects to managers who cannot say no, even when you need that person's leadership.

Delay the project rather than inappropriately assigning accountability. When accountability is assigned to managers that already have too much on their plate, they become stressed and non-productive. Which ends up costing the organization in time, money and staff goodwill.

**Team Member**

Is clear on their **specific responsibilities** and deliverables

**Challenges thinking** where appropriate

Supports the Project Manager to the best of their abilities

May be required to play an **organizational liaison** role – ensuring that any changes will be as 'palatable' as possible to the organization.

Depending upon the complexity and size of the project, these roles may be **full or part-time,**** **or held by the same person. There may also be other roles required – such as Project Administrator.

Any **other project resources **such as office facilities, computers, etc should also be clearly identified within the Project Plan.

**Section 3: Budget**

It's fairly likely that your organization already has reasonable procedures for developing **business cases** (cost/benefit analyses, payback periods, capital expenditure, net present values, etc), so we won't go into any detail here. Your financial people should be able to help you with this.

Suffice to say that budgetary approval is often the **biggest hurdle** that projects face, and a solid business case is your best friend.

It is also often a good idea to developing a series of **Best, Medium, and Worst Case**** **financial scenarios that take project risk into account.

**Section 4: Milestones****	**

Milestones are **major events** that need to be achieved to keep the project on track.

Initially milestones maybe only loosely defined, as information on subsequent steps maybe hard to ascertain. If this is the case, attempt to establish the milestones with the **best information at the time**.

Initial milestone accuracy is largely driven by project management experience.

**Tip: **when developing milestones, actively involve other project members. Start general, then move to specifics.

One of the most **common mistakes** inexperienced project managers make is to make the time gaps between milestones too long.

Milestones are great motivational tools – they give the project team regular feedback on progress, and as such the Project Manager should make every effort to use milestone completion as a '**rallying cry'** and a celebration of partial success. It does make a difference!

The change control (section 5) procedure helps with **updating milestones** when new information supersedes the originals.

**Section 5: Change Control**

Because projects impact on objectives, it is important to ensure project milestones are kept **accurate and current**.

At least quarterly, the sponsor should double-check that the project is still directly linked and aligned to the outcomes required to enhance the objectives and measures it was set up for.

Figure 7.1 outlines the steps required to establish and manage any project.

Figure 7.1 – Project Process

### 7.3.3. Phase 3: Project Execution

Every project has **unique characteristics**, varying in size and complexity. The demands placed on your organization from moving a department between floors are very different from a national upgrade of your IT network.

Some may be scribbled on the back of a cigarette packet, while others use of more **advanced productivity tools** such as spreadsheets and project planning software (such as Microsoft Project).

At the execution stage, your Project Plan may require **updating** at periodic intervals. These updates, which should only address significant issues such as a change of scope, an increased budget, a revised assessment of strategic linkage, or an extended timeframe, should be captured within a **revised Project Plan** (eg. Version 1.1) and noted in the Change Control section.

The discipline of keeping Project Plans updated and relevant keeps your organizational thinking focused. Otherwise you may, like countless others, lose sight of the bigger picture whilst immersed in the project detail.

### 7.3.4. Phase 4: Project Closure

For many organizations, this is undoubtedly the **most neglected** project stage.

Organizations, like many individuals, seem to find it difficult to take the time to **assess their experiences** and learn from them. They are often too keen to jump at the next exciting opportunity.

Project Closure doesn't need to be a huge exercise. Simply setting the key project individuals down in a room and asking a **few simple questions** is sufficient:

What did we **learn** from this project?

What did we do** well?**

What would we do differently the **next time?**

Do we need to **change** any organizational processes?

Ensure the Project Team answer the questions from both an individual and an organizational perspective. **It's worth it.**

Regardless of which project management methodology approach you use, there is one **fundamental issue** you cannot ignore…

## 7.4. Linking Projects to Strategy: The Matrix

… Go Keanu!

No, not that matrix!

As mentioned earlier, if projects are **not linked to strategies**, there is a real risk that resources can be deployed in non-strategic areas.

… which is a **waste **of time, money and value.

To link your projects, you must answer this **key question…**

' What strategic objective (or objectives) will this project enhance?'

Initially, any organization adopting the Practical Strategy approach needs to prioritize the projects it currently has under way. We recommend a simple but effective method.

Simply list all of the objectives from each of your strategies, one after the other (a spreadsheet is best – see Figure 7.2). Then assess each project by the strategic impact it has against each objective.

Some of your projects may no strategic impact, which means they are not strategically aligned. If this is the case there can only be one of two possibilities.

The project is not **strategically valid** and thus should be cancelled

Your strategies are lacking in certain areas and need to be **enhanced **to reflect reality.

The project matrix is an easy and powerful decision-making tool. We recommend that each **new project** be added to the matrix (and project register) and the completed ones removed.

As a minimum, at the start of each financial year this process should be carried out, as project expenditure, generally, is a **large but under-calculated** portion of total budgeted spend each year.

Here is an **example **of a project matrix…

Figure 7.2

## 7.5. The Project Register

**Remember** at the very beginning of this chapter when we asked 'How many projects are underway in your organization right now?'

How accurate do you think your estimate was? Do you think you were close? Is there **anyone** in your organization that could accurately answer the question?

Personally, we're not big fans of creating bureaucratic frameworks at the drop of a hat, but we've found that many organizations have benefited from creating and **allocating responsibility** for a simple **Project Register.**** **A centrally controlled spreadsheet is usually the best idea.

Which, as a minimum, has column headings detailing; Project Number, Project Name, Project Stage (Initiation, Definition, Execution, Closed), Project Owner, Summary Description, Strategic Linkages, Budget, Start Date and Completion Date.

The **key benefits** of such an approach are:

The knows what projects need to be commented on within the monthly reporting framework.

The Project Owners know that their efforts and progress are subject to **regular strategic scrutiny.**

The senior management team have a much better understanding of where, why and how organizational **resources are being used** (or misused).

Information needed for the **annual budgeting process** (planned capital expenditure, etc) is more accurate and easier to access.

If project spend is a large element of your organization's annual expenditure, we strongly recommend you adopt this approach. If used in conjunction with the Project Matrix, it will **significantly improve** your organization's visibility and use of resources.

## 7.6. Case Study: What Happened at Hunger Busters?

Lara has discussed the benefits of a **more effective approach** to allocating project resources within Hunger Busters with the senior management team.

She highlighted that last year, 15% percent ($68M) of the annual budget was spent on one-off activities that the senior team have historically has very little visibility on.

She argued a **strong case**, and has been given approval to work with the Operations Manager to implement the Practical Strategy Project framework organization-wide. All **significant** projects are now to be assessed and implemented using this approach.

Lara's first step was to create and then ensure that all existing significant projects were captured within the . Lara appointed Charlie Dempsey, one of Hunger Busters management accountants (who was keen to play a more strategic role), as the organization's project administrator – a part-time activity.

Hunger Busters has suffered from a **poor telephone system** for the last 18 months. With investment required elsewhere in the past, they decided hat it is time to look seriously at a new or upgraded system.

Lara believed that she should put her money where her mouth is, and volunteered to be the Given the likely level of budgetary approval required, the CEO was the Project Sponsor.

Lara **drafted Section One** (Project Purpose) of the and submitted it to the CEO for approval to move to the next stage.

This is what the completed Section 1 looked like …

**Hunger Busters PROJECT PLAN**

**Section 1: Project Purpose**

**1.1. Definition of Problem/Opportunity**** **

Hunger Busters Australia's current phone system is **substandard** for the size and complexity of the organization. Head Office in Sydney is most affected, however all Australian area offices utilize the current standard Telstra GB143 system. At Sydney and Melbourne voice messages are often lost and staff cannot always dial out due to a **shortage of lines.** Further, Hunger Busters Internet connection speed is limited to 33Kps.

******1.2. Specific Project Outcomes & Benefits**

This project will look at the purchase of a **new/upgraded service** for all phones (fixed and mobile) within Australia. 600 (400 fixed, 200 mobile) phones will be affected, with voice and Internet services also being considered.

**Benefits**

Improved staff productivity

Improved customer service

Lower 'per call' costs, due to move to integrated call/data package.

**1.3. Strategic Linkages**

This project supports these current strategies and objectives:

**Corporate Strategy **

Optimize Productivity

Listen and Respond to the Customer

Improve all levels of Communication

**Restaurant and Area Strategies**

Enhance Communication

**Information Technology Strategy**

Deliver Effective Telecommunication Services

**Marketing Strategy**

Listen and React to Customer's Needs

**1.3. Potential Negative Outcomes**

The cost of maintaining and running the telephone system may increase due to more phone time access. However we expect to be able to negotiate much lower per call charges and greater service for employees and customers

**1.4. Critical Success Factors **

A telecommunications service provider that can deliver what they promise. There is a lot of new technology in the marketplace currently and the initial feedback is to be mindful of companies that promise the world, but deliver little. To counter this we will only purchase from a company that can show us an installed operating solution, with a happy customer.

Involvement of at least one person from I.T. who is working on the current phone system.

**1.5.****	 Assumptions**

That the Board will approve the CAPEX, projected spend and NPV calculations

**1.6. Indicative Budget & Timeframe**

At this stage, it is believed that the project will cost around $800K, and take just over 9 months to complete (national rollout). These figures will be confirmed should this project be approved to move to the definition stage.

Lara submitted Section 1 to the Project Sponsor, the CEO, who after **clarifying a few points** about potential team members, approved the project to move to the next stage – Project Definition.

As Project Owner, Lara now **completed Sections 2-5 …**

******Section 2: Resources**

**2.1. Team Configuration **

The following 3 members comprise the Project Team:

**2.2. Communications**

Project communication will be managed as follows:

Fortnightly Project Update, notes to be sent to Executive Sponsor

2. Progress updated monthly via Scorecard

**Section 3: Budget**

**3.1 CAPEX and NPV**

The Net Present Value (NPV) for the project will be **slightly negative,** as the project will not dramatically affect inward cash flow. However, we have projected a slight increase in revenues due to greater customer loyalty and we expect a **positive impact** on the cost per call rate and current maintenance bill.

The NPV (using a discount rate of 10%) was -$52,000, over 5 years. This assumes a 30% increase in the utilization of phones. If the NPV is run for the same number of existing phones (350), over five years the NPV is positive, ($ 66,000) due to expected savings in maintenance.

Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) required

$ 100, 000 in new Phones

$ 750,000 new PABX

$ 50,000 new line installation

$ 125,000 new wiring, and other services

**Total: AUD $ 1.025 Million **

**Scenarios**

**Spend**

Best Case $ 850,000

Worst Case $ 1,500,000

**Most Likely $ 1,025,000**

**Project NPV **

Best Case (@ 9%) 	$ - 0

Worst Case (@11.5%) 	$ -230,000

**Most Likely (@10%) ****	$-52,000**

The risk assessment showed a normal discount factor of 10%, Time Risk (not completing the project on time, .3), Resource Risk (risk that risks will not be available when required, .35), Strategic Risk (risk of project non performance on business outcomes, .2), Financial Risk (risk that the budget will not be enough, .15)

Lara ran the scenarios increasing the **resource and time risk** and decreasing the Strategic risk. The increase in time risk reflected the comment by a certain customer visited that the Telco Company had a limited resource for larger workloads.

Due to strong growth and expansion plans at Hunger Busters, she also felt it prudent to **increase the Resource Risk** for worst-case thinking. On the positive side Lara lowered the financial risk as she had secured the budget and the likelihood of budget overruns was low. The Telco customer visits confirmed this.

******Section 4: Milestones**

The following milestones will be achieved during the Project.

**Section 5: Change Control**

Nil Changes as at 01/02/2002

This project plan was **approved** by the CEO, and entered into the **project register.** Telstra's new GB5000 PABX, with mobile and ISDN (min 256k – 1Meg max) solution was installed at the Sydney office in the last week of May.

For a couple of months the system displayed several bugs that some managers found frustrating. These managers provided **direct feedback** against the project via the **scorecard reporting framework**, resulting in Telstra being engaged to fix the issues within the test timeframe.

The remaining milestones were delivered ahead of schedule, and the project was completed on the first of December 2002, with the Project Leader (Lara) and the CEO very happy with the project. With total spend at $958,000; the project was regarded as a success.

**Upon completion,** the project was removed from the scorecard and updated as 'complete' within the project register. In order to ensure ongoing effectiveness, **two new measures** were added to the strategic objective 'Deliver Effective Telecommunication Services' within the IT strategy: These were 'Average internet Connection Speed' and 'Number of Internal Communication Complaints'.

# 8. REPORT & COMMUNICATE

Once you've made some progress with the Practical Strategy approach, you'll realize that you have lots of **different bits of information** all over your organization - strategies, scorecards, projects and measures.

The managers in your organization need to report progress against these . They also need **easy access** to this information and be able **make sense**** **of it all.

For most organizations (except the very small), this will mean investment in a **technology solution** that supports their strategic framework.

Choosing and implementing a technology solution to support the Practical Strategy approach is a **critically important**** **activity.

The information in this chapter helps you make **informed technology decisions** for your organization.

## 8.1. Why Do You Need Technology?

Unless you are a **very** small organization, it's likely that you're going to need some sort of scorecard technology solution. An effective technology solution helps **in many ways:**

Communicating your **strategic message** – through personal desktop systems that reinforce the business direction.

Providing a clear and accessible 'information framework' for **management discussion** and debate.

Increases **speed** of shared understanding through agreed (and day-to-day use of) terminology.

Streamlines and simplifies **management reporting** – each manager can quickly and regularly update their areas of responsibility.

Clearly defining **accountability** for objectives and measures.

Providing **'fingertip access'**** **to key performance measures for decision-makers.

Allowing powerful **information-search** tools for those with integrated systems hooked into, or included with, their scorecard application (more on this soon…)

You may wish to attempt to roll out your scorecard framework via **desktop productivity tools** such as spreadsheets and email.

And the subsequent technical difficulties may result in people **abandoning **the scorecard concept because of the hassle of working 'the system'.

Which is why we **strongly recommend**** **you consider buying a software application specifically designed for the task at hand.

But before you spend any cash, you need to be **armed** with the right information...

## 8.2. When Should You Start thinking About Technology?

A key issue surrounding a scorecard implementation is when to consider purchasing technology.

The main factors that you need to consider are:

**Are you developing one scorecard or a scorecard process?***** ***Many companies have a corporate scorecard that they roll out to the executive team but no further. A full Practical Strategy implementation runs from the boardroom to the washroom, across multiple strategies and multiple levels within the organization. Within such an environment, where **at least 30 people** are required to contribute to multiple strategies, technology will be a critical success factor in providing a practical solution.

**Pilot versus Full rollout. ** It isn't necessary to buy a full organization-wide solution on day one. A 'pilot' involving key business managers (try to involve at least **two organizational levels**) will allow you to assess the technology fit, process changes and a whole host of other practical issues that need to be considered before the solution goes organization-wide.

**Budgets & Cash flow.** As a general rule, Technology = Money. In this case, anywhere from a couple of thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands. If you're in the process of pulling budgets together while you're reading this, ensure you have enough budget for at least a pilot technology project. **Even better** is to earmark additional budget that allows you to continue to expand your technology solution should you decide that your pilot was a success*. *

**Existing Technology*****. *** If you have an existing that doesn't have an integrated scorecard module, then the issue could be whether or not you want a scorecard solution that is **separate**** **from your existing system. We'll come back to this issue in more detail later in this chapter.

**Technology decisions made further up the corporate chain*****.*** If you work for a large multi-national, your information systems decisions may be made at the corporate level, or perhaps even in another geographic region. Your biggest issue with selecting and implementing a scorecard system may be convincing the bureaucracy above to run with a 'non-standard' application.

Far be it from us to recommend **bending company policy**, but a stand-alone system that doesn't need to integrate with your other systems and can **sneaked under the radar** might be your best option.

**Manager's Attitude to Technology*****. *** Perhaps one of hardest issues to address is the approach by managers (especially executives) towards using new technology. Some managers will grasp the strength and flexibility of a technology solution, where as others will need a lot of help.

Generally, we recommended that you budget for a **pilot technology solution,** with the intention to spend more if it works for you. Be wary of vendors that recommend you spend lots of money before you've addressed the issues above.

## 8.3. What's The Best Solution For Your Organization?

First, a little bit of background …

### 8.3.1. The First Scorecard Technology Solution

In the early nineties, wrote in a series of Harvard Business Review articles about the Balanced Scorecard, focusing heavily on the measures that could deliver success within the business. They educated us on the benefits of the and the lag and lead measures within these perspectives.

In particular, as David Norton developed his consulting practices (Renaissance World-wide) in this area, he appeared to pick up on how his clients tended to use this process to **drive strategic change***, *not just measurement and accountability change.

However it wasn't till Kaplan and Norton's in 1997, that the wider market got to really understand that the scorecard process was a lot more about strategy rather than just about measurement.

During 1997, Renaissance World-wide realized that to truly add value to medium-large organizations, the scorecard process should be **automated.**** ** So they searched for, and found, a technology partner.

In 1998, Renaissance World-wide and Gentia Software developed and released a software product - **The Renaissance Balanced Scorecard**.

This product didn't take long to generate a fair amount on noise in the then, market. At that time Gentia Software had the scorecard and a customizable solution to offer clients.

They and their competitors quickly realized that from a technology standpoint, the scorecard was **just another** software application.

Thus, the applications age was born, spearheaded by the scorecard application.

The scorecard **quickly gathered momentum** and many of Gentia's competitors looked to include a scorecard in their database solution, because the market demand was beginning to grow, and Gentia was carving out a niche for itself that threatened to be very profitable.

The trouble for the other vendors was that Renaissance had signed an exclusive deal with Gentia Software for two years. However, with the amount of information on the scorecard process in general circulation, it wasn't hard for other database vendors to develop/copy/buy a product that reflected the** '****public understanding'**** **of a scorecard.

The key difference at this time was that "The Renaissance Balanced Scorecard" was a product produced for Strategy focused scorecards, whereas many of the competing products were **measurement focused** and reflected more of the database vendors core technology strengths, rather than customer strategy communication and feedback needs.

And that concludes our **short history** of the very first commercial scorecard technology solution.

### 8.3.2. Your Software Options

There are many 'systems' that help manage an organization: Balanced Scorecard, Value-Based Management, Economic Value Added, Activity-based Costing, etc …

(Apologies for the **festival of jargon**** ****–** almost over!)

… collectively these are often referred to as 'Enterprise Management Systems'.

And initially, there were only a few software vendors in this category.

The next few pages categorize the different 'types' of scorecard software vendors. There are many 'sub-segments' in this field, but, for the sake of clarity, we have **categorized** them into two distinct camps.

The first one is …

**The ****ERP**** ****Vendors**

The vendors offering a scorecard solution are:

These companies are using the applications that work with their ERP systems as the foundation for their scorecard applications. This approach addresses some of the common integration issues that have plagued many scorecard projects to date.

While many industry observers initially doubted the ERP vendors' ability to be effective in this area, it appears that they're doing pretty well.

**But what do you do** if you don't have an ERP system that provides a scorecard option? (or you do, but you don't like their offering?)

******The ****Niche**** ****Providers**

The products that these organizations offer have come mostly from a background where the core technology has been used for analytical applications.

The key advantage of these products is that they are **easier to integrate** with other systems, and in many cases offer a simpler 'stand-alone' scorecard solution.

The **players in this area** include …

Table 8.1 – Selection of Niche Scorecard Software Vendors

You may at this stage be wondering which software solution we recommend. The short answer is: **we don't. **

Technology changes too fast. Whatever we write will be out of date in a few months, and in the end, **only you** know what the best solution for your organization will be.

However, if you're looking for a **more detailed independent view** (perhaps you've decided not to engage an external consultant for example), you can contact

What technology you already **have in place**

How much information you want to pull from your **other systems**

Your **budget** (a.k.a. Senior Management Commitment)

How many people will use the system (not all solutions are easily scalable)

How much you **trust** the vendor/implementer to deliver on their promises (based on visits to other vendor customers)

### 8.3.3. Scorecard Technology: A Short History

If you'd like **more detail** about scorecard technology issues - this section is for you.

If you're still developing your knowledge in this area, we strongly recommend that you ask your senior technical person to read it too. Then schedule a meeting for a few hours to share your understanding of what this means for your organization.

Or you can **read this later,** and skip to

Organizations prior the nineteen eighties existed around a **strict hierarchical structure**. Executive, middle and line management all had strongly defined roles and responsibilities.

This type of organizational structure was invented by the ancient Chinese army to better manage its fighting capability, and has **hardly changed** in the last four thousand years.

The information systems put into place during this time reflected this management structure and tended to be **rigid and hierarchical** as well, with **little communication** between the different systems.

These systems were based around the first generation mainframe based executive information systems for the top-level management with MIS databases and query tools for the middle management layer.

Companies began to **automate** much of the information gathering and dissemination functions that previously had been the preserve of the middle management layers. The authority to make decisions was pushed further **down the hierarchy** into line management and customer facing employees.

As well as the commercial pressures on companies to change the way they did business, the **pace of technology change** was also accelerating. Information technology in particular had been embraced by business as a way of speeding the operational activities and improving efficiency. As time went by, **computing costs fell.**

It became clear as the nineties moved on that simply increasing the amount of data processed, or the speed at which this was done was not going to significantly help in greater efficiency. People were simply **swamped with information**, but much of it was either out of date or reflected past performance of the business rather than predicting future trends.

During the 1980's and early 1990's it was commonplace (it is not uncommon today either) to see **organizations struggling** with disparate data sources.

The General Ledger wouldn't talk to the payroll system; the payroll system wouldn't talk to the HR management system, none of these systems worked with the manufacturing system etc.

Thus the focus for many IT departments was (and still is in some cases) on the **integration** of disparate transactional systems.

A major driver at the time was for the organization to have one data source (a relational database) that allowed organization to transact business processes effectively and report information consistently and accurately.

Relational databases have been used heavily in the areas of operations and control. To be successful in this arena, relational database vendors place a premium on the highly efficient execution of a **large number of small transactions**, process aggregation and during the nineties data warehousing.

During the eighties and nineties a small number of enlightened companies took the opportunity **not** to necessarily integrate all systems via expansive all-in-one relational database projects, that inevitability fell short of the showy projects goals, but always lived up to the expense and effort.

Instead these organizations integrated certain (almost exclusively) financial into OLAP (On Line Analytical Processing) systems.

These systems had the ability to report data across a number of different business units or product lines very quickly, with a **reporting flexibility** that enabled managers to drill into problem areas within seconds, rather than the hours, if not days, for similar data from relational transaction systems.

The era of EIS (Executive Information Systems) was born. And the early adopters benefited from greater informational power that enabled them to **quickly access** and track areas of interest within the business.

Back in the early 90's however there was little in the way of a **common interface language** between OLAP and relational databases and even less between OLAP providers. This meant organizations had to spend a lot of time and effort in establishing and deploying Executive Information Systems (EIS), and later, (DSS) tools.

More recently, relational database vendors have also sold their databases as tools for building Data Warehouses.

While OLAP systems have the **ability to answer** "who?" and "what?" questions, it is their ability to answer "what if?" and "why?" that sets them apart from Data Warehouses.

OLAP enables decision-making about future actions. A typical OLAP calculation is more complex than simply summing data, **for example****:** "What would be the effect on soft drink costs to distributors if syrup prices went up by $.10/gallon and transportation costs went down by $.05/mile?"

OLAP and Data Warehouses are **complementary**. A Data Warehouse stores and manages data. OLAP transforms Data Warehouse data into strategic information.

OLAP ranges from basic navigation and browsing (often known as "slice and dice"), to calculations, to more serious analyses such as time series and complex modeling. As decision-makers exercise **more advanced** OLAP capabilities, they move from data access … to information … to knowledge.

As the OLAP market continued to grow it became known as the field of . Basically, Business Intelligence is the field of technology that deals with Executive Information Systems, Decision Support Systems and Data Marts.

During the mid nineties, many organizations improve their reporting to levels that their competitors **could only dream of**, but it wasn't till the late nineties that Business Intelligence and Strategy combined to form a true competitive advantage for those companies that implemented integrated scorecards.

One of the forerunners in this area was Cognos. In 1996–97, they commissioned Dr Richard Connelly, Robin McNeil and Roland Mosimann to author, "The Multi Dimensional Managers – 24 Ways to improve your Bottom line in 90 days". This short book is a great introduction to the benefits of multi-dimensional information, and **we definitely recommend** that you read it then give it to the technical person supporting you in this project.

Cognos was one of the first vendors to make **real steps** in combining business consulting knowledge with product strength. Interestingly however they did not lead the charge into the true applications age.

The driving force in this arena in the late nineties was a small British software company called** ****Gentia**** **Software. David Norton's (co-creator of the Balanced Scorecard concept) then company Renaissance Worldwide, collaborated with Gentia Software, a Business Intelligence provider, to produce the world's first commercial automated scorecard.

During the late nineties many of specialist Business Intelligence vendors (CorVu, Seagate, Hyperion, Business Objects, Pilot) included a scorecard, but the solution **changed the face** of Business Intelligence. Business Intelligence for some time had been knocking on the door of true business improvement, through automating and efficiently reporting key information.

Often though the Business Intelligence system would **fall flat **within an organization because the applications were specific to only a few people or departments. E.g. A Health and Safety application maybe used by operational managers daily but by senior managers only if there was a review of serious injury. Also, applications started more and more to need strategic consulting expertise to map and **improve business processes** before the software application was built and deployed.

This lead to some Business Intelligence systems becoming **isolated** within the business they were trying to serve and the Business Intelligence vendors started requiring more and more consultative sale teams to sell their complex solution style products.

This slowed the sales cycle, increased internal tensions on what the Business Intelligence vendor's core competence was - technology or business improvement.

With the entry of the scorecard, initially some, but now nearly all OLAP software vendors have seen the value of having integrated performance management systems, or what can be called an **Enterprise Management System** (see Figure 8.1 below).

Figure 8.1

They can benefit from the product style applications of ABC, EVA, and CRM with the benefit that the **key performance drivers** will also end up in the strategic system via the scorecard.

Thus, their solution will be used more and more across the entire organizations, (rather than just departmentally) by more and more managers, increasing effectiveness through common communication.

But the OLAP vendors have also **retained the flexibility** they had as Business Intelligence vendors. If you want your application customized, no problem, want a scorecard drilling down into departmental systems, no problem.

The current environment of OLAP and ROLAP is now part of the **applications age** (see Figure 8.2 on next page) and reflect the need by organizations for Enterprise Management Systems.

Figure 8.2

Most of the traditional OLAP vendors e.g. Hyperion, Seagate, Gentia, CorVu, Pilot, Business Objects, Cognos, etc and Relational database vendors e.g. Oracle and ERP – Enterprise Resource Planning vendors such as SAP, BAAN and Peoplesoft now talk in this way.

When one party (the Vendor) has more information than another party (you – the buyer) they will seek to understand **your knowledge level**, highlight that they understand your position and then bond with you by showing you all of the features that they have that fits with your understanding.

The reality in the EMS market, especially around scorecard solutions (due to the differences of opinion on what a scorecard is), what you see and think you are getting can often be quite different from what you need.

**Tread carefully** – and ask lots of questions.

## 8.4. How Much Does Scorecard Software Cost?

The short answer is, as usual - it depends.

You'll normally have to hand over an **initial payment**, and then an **ongoing annual fee**** **('maintenance') for upgrades – an agreed percentage of the initial payment.

You'll need to know …

What the **capabilities** of your existing technologies are.

**How many** people will use the system.

How much information you want to **'pull through' **from your other systems (database integration can cost big money).

How much **flexibility** you want for future development.

What percentage the vendor charges as an for **'maintenance'** – an ongoing annual fee to cover upgrades (usually around 15-20% of purchase price).

**How keen** the vendor is to sell you a solution (it may be near the end of a quarter, and they're chasing a sales target).

To get **specific costs** for your situation, you'll need to speak to a vendor.

And when you do … **Beware**** **of confusing pricing models!

Another area **you need to understand** is how the software vendors price their products. At the last count we found at least 8 different approaches.

Different vendors use different models to calculate how much your solution will cost. The **most common pricing models** are:

**Bottom Line?** Make sure you're comparing apples with apples.

However, as a **very rough rule of thumb …**

## 8.5. Choosing & Implementing a Solution: Practical Tips

**Get Help**** -** Unless you're 100% sure you've understood everything in this chapter **and** you have a very smart IT person in your organization, you're going to need external help to choose and implement your technology solution.

We recommend that you appoint an independent specialist from a reputable consulting firm. Ideally, this individual should have at least 5 organizational implementations under their belt. Ask for references! Look them in the eye - make sure you trust them.

**Take an 'overall solution' approach.** Don't get sidetracked by 'silo' discussions about software, hardware, networks, etc. The total solution has to work! It's no good having a great software application that falls over on dodgy hardware.

You may wish to consider a **'Prime Vendor' **approach that makes one organization responsible for the overall solution – hardware/software/database integration, etc. However, you're putting lots of eggs in one basket with this approach - ask them lots of hard questions and speak to previous clients!

**Be clear on your business needs,**** **specifically on how much your scorecard application will integrate with your other information system databases (performance management/budgets/etc) **before** you get too focused on specific tools and solutions.

Your technology people and your independent consultant should be able to explain the process that they have used for other technology selections. Blend their thinking with what you're reading here.

Concentrate on **your** specific requirements and objectives, and put more effort into the references and relationship elements of the selection process.

**Be clear on your initial Database Integration needs*****. *** Some scorecard vendors enable data entry straight into the scorecard solution. This means that is not initially required, allowing a pilot scorecard to be rolled out quickly and simply. However, if you intend to later connect some form of performance management system to such a stand-alone system, don't forget to budget for the subsequent database integration costs.

**Set organizational expectations**** **at the right level and manage them throughout your implementation. Be clear on what you're going to do – and not do. Don't be beguiled by the vendor's promises of "all you can eat … and more!" You **will **come across obstacles along the way, so stay clear on what you're there to do.

**Don't outsource everything.** You need to retain internal ownership and knowledge of the solution. You can delegate responsibility, but not accountability.

**Build your relationships with stakeholders****.** Lots of people will be affected by your technology selection and implementation – IT people, finance people, line management, senior management. Just because you've developed some specialist knowledge in this area doesn't mean that you need to 'tell them what's right'. Listen and take into account to their needs and concerns – your system will stand a much higher chance of acceptance if you do. Communicate regularly.

**Be clear on your implementation methodology.**** **Your independent consultant should have lots of knowledge in this area. Make sure you have an understanding of the implementation project plans and **key dates.** Hold people to account on 'deliverables'. Encourage an 'X by Y' mindset - I'll complete this task (X) by 15 August (Y).

**Be flexible.** Your implementation will ebb and flow around your project plan - be prepared to adjust your project milestones if need be. Your project may even need to be re-scoped if it drifts too far away from the required outcomes (which often happens).

**Executive Commitment.** A technology project of this nature needs executive commitment. Without it, it will become your responsibility and not the organizations.

**Customer Visits.** **DO NOT** select a technology solution without visiting another organization that has been down a similar path. Learn from their mistakes (and they'll have made a few!) And remember to ask them what their users think of the system.

**Get the benefits** of reading . Your technology selection and implementation is a project, just like any other. Do it right.

## 8.7. Case Study: What Happened at Hunger Busters?

Two years ago, Hunger Busters invested in a $3.5 Million dollar (Enterprise Resource Planning) solution. Included in this installation was the ERP vendor's **Performance Management module** that allows managers to run Key Performance Indicator reports by Business Unit.

At the time, the ERP vendor made very strong claims about their performance management and reporting capabilities. **Sadly,** these claims have failed to live up to expectations.

The ERP project was delivered over time and over budget, which has lead to IT projects being closely monitored by the Senior Management Team.

Lara's first challenge was to convince the IT Director that a **review** of Hunger Busters existing reporting systems was warranted, and that an independent consultant was the best resource to do this.

Lara put a small team together, including a part-time consultant, to develop a project that would improve Hunger Busters strategy and performance reporting capability. Naturally, she used a formal method of Project Management, and developed a Project Plan. Key elements of this Plan came from Lara's understanding of the she had read earlier.

The **first key issue** was to decide whether Hunger Busters could build on their ERP investment and buy an effective scorecard and Performance Management solution from their existing vendor.

The current ERP vendor had a scorecard 'module'. However, implementing it would have required another **expensive upgrade** of the core ERP solution, an activity that Lara knows the senior management team would have been unwilling to do.

Lara met with the IT Director to discuss the **in-house capability** to build a scorecard that could meet the needs detailed in the preliminary Project Plan. The IT Director remarked, 'Can we do it? Yep, we can do anything!', 'Can we do it on time, to the required specification, meeting a certain budget …**I doubt it.'**

This type of solution is new to them, they have no real design expertise and the outputs, would be (most likely) delivered via the Internet. They are also heavily behind in existing workloads. So in this case, building the solution is **not a viable option**.

Lara then met six software vendors, assessed their offerings (using the Practical Strategy as a starting point) and viewed their product demonstrations.

At this point she felt uneasy, as several of the vendors seemed to have a **different approach** to scorecards.

Lara re-read , and then selected the two vendors that seemed to offer a solution closest to Hunger Busters needs. She then asked them to set up **customer visits.** She insisted that her fellow senior managers – including the CEO, attend these meetings.

**Note: **Lara **made sure** that the vendors told the selected organizations that her CEO would be attending, as the visiting customer site will most likely have their CEO meet her CEO before the demonstration. Lara has learned from past experience that it can be **very embarrassing** to other organizations if a CEO from another organization turns up unannounced.

After seeing these **two solutions in action**, she them provided both vendors with a complete Hunger Busters scorecard to build within their applications – including a Strategy Map, measures and a project, with allocated management accountability.

Lara then arranged for the senior team to be part of the live product tests, not only to review functionality, but also to ensure that they all had the **same level of understanding** regarding the complete Practical Strategy approach (from strategy development through to strategic performance reporting).

Following a short period of negotiation, Hunger Busters decided to purchase a 50-user license of TopScorecard (no such company exists).

They then agreed to purchase the first 50 licenses and **upon successful implementation**, integration and a six-month deployment, would purchase a full site (company) license.

## 8.8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

My organization won't commit to buying a scorecard technology solution. What should I do?

Most organizations (ie. senior managers) that shy away from buying a solution have one of two issues.

1. They **don't understand**, or believe in, the **principles** of scorecards. In which case, they're quite right to reject any spend on an 'an unproven theory' (in their minds).

They may also have heard of other organizations that have attempted to adopt a scorecard approach by implementing technology then waiting (unsuccessfully) for the promised benefits. It just doesn't work that way. You need to do the **hard thinking first** (as outlined in this guide) - then make your technology decision.

If this is the scenario in your organization, you need to work harder to **explain the benefits** of the concept to them. Running the senior management team meeting detailed in the chapter , then moving on to develop a few strategies is a good start.

In short, sell them on the benefits of the concept first, **then** the technology.

The **other issue** is …

2. The senior team buys into the scorecard concept, but they can't see where **'yet ****another technology purchase'** adds any value.

These organizations may have **already invested** in an ERP system with some form of reporting or performance management tool. And the question often asked is 'Our existing systems report lots of measures, so **why can't we use them?**'

And it's a good question to be asking too.

The issue here is one of **fitness for purpose**. You wouldn't use a desktop publishing program to calculate your department's annual budget.

And in this case, you can't use a system that has been designed to pump out numbers and measures to develop and **communicate** strategy maps and strategic objectives.

In a nutshell, these existing reporting and/or performance measurement systems are usually working at **too low a level.**

If this is the scenario in your organization, you need to help people understand that the benefits of a scorecard solution **go** **beyond** simply reporting on measures. You need to stress the benefits of a technology that allows an **ongoing strategic discussion** within your organization.

I can't find any organizations in my area that have implemented a scorecard technology solution. Should I press on without speaking to anyone?

**Preferably not. **

Frank discussions with other organizations that have been down a similar route to the one you're planning are arguably the **best return** on your investment in the technology selection process. You'll learn a lot about the overall process, the technology, and the vendor by listening to the voices of experience.

At the very least, prepare a number of **questions** to ask over the phone.

# 9. KEEP THE COMMITMENT…

Let's quickly **recap**. So far you've:

Carried out all the analysis to get clear on what your organization's **issues** are (Identify your Opportunities and Challenges),

Used this knowledge to figure out what your **strategic objectives** are (Develop your Strategy),

Created a suite of measures that indicate how **effective** you are at moving towards your objectives (Build your Measures)

Made sure that all your important **initiatives are supporting** your strategies (Align and Implement your Projects)

Possibly invested in a **software solution that communicates** your strategies and streamlines your reporting process (Report & Communicate).

So** what's next? …**** **

Dietary experts often make the claim that **losing weight** is easier than keeping it off.

The same could be said for getting your organization working with the Practical Strategy approach.

Whilst it's important (and fun!) to celebrate the success of getting the Practical Strategy approach 'live' in your organization, it's more important that you **keep the momentum going**.

**Important Note:** The effectiveness of your initial monthly meeting to discuss your scorecards will define your future success with this approach.

Basically, you need to make sure your organization is **equipped** to get the most out of your investment. Here's how …

## 9.1. Who 'Owns' Your New Scorecard Process?

Unless you want all your hard work to be a 'flash in the pan', this is undoubtedly the **most important question** you have to answer at this stage.

You need to address **six distinct areas** of ownership:

If you don't assign clear ownership, take your **diary** out right now and block out lots of time over the next few months. You're going to need it to **'fight fires'** that other people should be responsible for!

### 9.1.1. Senior Management

This person has **ultimate responsibility** for keeping the Practical Strategy approach and processes alive in your organization.

**Who else** but them has the organizational overview and authority to develop or modify top-level strategy?

Make sure your CEO is **crystal clear** on the tasks that they need to make happen …

Ensuring the new reporting processes becomes part of the **management culture** (aka: 'the way things are done round here').

Overseeing the creation of scorecards **beyond the pilot** **phase**, in other parts of the organization.

**Reviewing** existing strategies, measures and projects when necessary.

### 9.1.2. Scorecard Management

Nothing will **kill your efforts** to date as effectively as poor scorecard management.

Your new management information framework is only as good as its inputs, and if the managers in your business are struggling to update their scorecards (because they need better training, or their measures are out of date), then you're **heading for trouble**.

Initially we recommend that the who has been the driving force behind your organization's scorecard efforts to date, assume this role. Hopefully, this will be you!

This person is in the **unique position** of understanding the overall process, as well as the detailed content (objectives, measures and projects).

The role of Scorecard Manager is normally a **part-time responsibility,** unless you work for a huge organization with hundreds of scorecards.

The **Scorecard Manager's tasks** usually include:

**Listening** to legitimate gripes about 'the new system', and making sure they're acted on.

Ensuring **timely and accurate** scorecard submission (from the owners of strategies, objectives, measures and projects)

**Updating** and adding new objectives and measures

Entering projects into appropriate scorecards

Adding and training new users in the scorecard technology solution

**Ultimately**, ensuring 'the process' works.

**Note:** It is often a good idea to make this person accountable for the management of the too.

### 9.1.3. Strategy Owners

A Strategy Owner is responsible for assessing all the monthly responses from the multiple owners of objectives and measures within their strategy, and deciding whether or not their strategy (specifically their Strategic Theme) is 'on track'. And if not, what to do about it.

### 9.1.4. Objective Owners

An Objective Owner is responsible for submitting their monthly assessment of whether or not their objective (such as 'easy to do business with') is being **achieved.** Objective owners are spread throughout the organization, operating at multiple levels.

They make their assessment on the basis of how well their chosen measures (both quantitative and qualitative) have performed. Remember, an objective may have multiple measures.

### 9.1.5. Measure Owners

A Measure Owner is responsible for submitting their assessment of whether or not the monthly target for their measure (such as 'new sales leads generated) is being achieved. You will most likely have a **large number** of measure owners spread throughout your organization, operating at multiple levels.

### 9.1.6. Project Owners

As their title suggests, Project Owners (often called Project Managers) are ultimately responsible for reporting on the progress of the projects they manage - which in most cases, should be clearly defined in a

## 9.2. The Critical Importance of Your First Monthly Review

Many organizations make the **mistake** of thinking that just because they've taken the time to develop their first strategies and scorecards that it's time to **celebrate and 'cruise'** for a while.

… which is a** ****recipe for disaster.**** **

Unless your organization's **very first** management discussion about your scorecard's objectives, measures and projects are focused and effective, you're setting an expectation that **'talk fests'** with no concrete outcomes are acceptable.

Your monthly scorecard meetings should be the **focus** of all your management reporting and discussion. If you have an existing monthly management meeting process – toss the agenda away, and replace it with a **new agenda** that supports your scorecard process.

Your monthly meeting is your organization's **key strategic and performance discussion forum**. Don't turn it into a discussion of last month's numbers – you need to be future-focused!

Here is a typical meeting scenario …

**Before the meeting …**

Each person has **previously completed** their monthly strategy report (normally a couple of days before the meeting the allow for information collation/processing). Specifically, everyone has assessed and reported on the strategic components – objectives, measures and projects - that they are accountable for.

Also, you need to ensure that any information that will make the meeting more effective, such as the **latest strategy/scorecard information** is readily available. Ideally you should have printouts of key reports supported by a 'live' connection to your Scorecard technology solution. However, a paper-based version will suffice if that's all you have.

**Typical Agenda Items**

**Progress review** of each objective, supported by discussions on associated measures and projects.

Progress review of **projects** – current and future (for those not already discussed)

Feedback on alignment and validity of cause-and effect relationships, objectives, measures and projects. This part of the meeting is where your **real 'Strategic Discussion'** takes place. If you gloss over it, you'll eventually find yourself back having ineffectual 'annual strategy sessions'. This discussion is where you keep your strategy **dynamic** and responsive to constantly changing issues.

**Actions arising** – including updating scorecard information. Nothing will kill your future meetings quicker than incorrect or outdated information!

## 9.3. Fine-Tune, Tweak & Improve …

However, your scorecards are far from perfect. Your strategies and processes are a first cut. You need to **take the time to listen** to legitimate gripes about what's been done to date, and improve them.

Perhaps one of your objectives has conflicting measures. Or your technology system has a few bugs, or maybe some of your managers need a bit of extra training.

**Don't ignore** these issues. If you hope to spread the concept throughout your organization, it's hard to talk up the big picture benefits if you've skipped the small stuff.

## 9.4. Re-assess Your Technology Needs

Hopefully, you have bought a scorecard technology solution that **fitted your needs.**

If you haven't yet bought any technology to support your scorecard needs, and you're pretty sure that the concept is valid and workable in your organization, you may find it **worthwhile **to re-assess your technology needs.

If you choose not to buy a technology solution, expect to spend more time dealing with **basic communication issues****,** like explaining to managers how to update and send in their scorecards, and what measures they 'own'. This 'manual' approach doesn't make it impossible, just a lot harder.

Conversely, if you have implemented a technology solution, and you've had a successful pilot, make sure you **understand the role** that technology has played.

In most cases, you'll find that it's **impossible to visualize** your scorecard process without the supporting software. Now may be the time to go back to your software vendor and negotiate (hard) for more licenses as your user base grows.

## 9.5. Challenge your Strategies Regularly

You may recall reading way back in the Introduction that one of the **biggest myths** about strategy was that it's a once-a-year exercise.

The key task for each owner of an organization's Strategies, Objectives, Measures and Projects is to **report on progress** against target, normally on a monthly basis.

However, the beauty of the scorecard process is the opportunity for them to comment on the **validity** of each of these components as well.

Keep your strategies relevant by **updating them regularly** - don't let a few months go by without making any changes at all. They can't be that perfect!

**A simple example** (which we come across regularly) is an unaligned measure …

Let's say that one of the Business Units in a company has the objective of 'Increasing Profitability'**. Four months** into the new scorecard process, the owner of this particular objective (The Business Unit Manager) realizes that the reports she receives (and has done for the last 3 years) only provide information on revenue.

In her next monthly scorecard report, she identifies this issue, and the management accountant is subsequently tasked to create a new profit report from the financial system. The Scorecard Manager also **updates** the Business Unit's scorecard with a new profit measure.

**Note:** naturally, this example could be applied to any of your strategic components (themes, objectives, measures or projects).

What is critical, and what isn't, can **only be decided** by the owner of each component. However, it's a good idea to re-assess them at least every 12 months to ensure they still support your organization's direction.

**Common examples** of the need to modify existing thinking include:

Discovery of unaligned objectives or measures

Market activity that requires a significant response (eg. a new cut-price competitor entering your industry)

A structural change in your organization

Basically, anything that impacts on **What** you want to achieve and **How** you're your going to get it – at **any level** in your organization.

Think of your strategies as living entities, constantly modifying themselves to suit changing environmental conditions.

However, remember that changing strategic components in one area can often have a **knock-on effect** in other areas. Modifications and removal should not be taken too lightly.

## 9.6. Don't Forget Ongoing Education

One of the biggest problems with working with the Practical Strategy approach is the **apparent simplicity** of the concept.

Most people initially have the impression that it's simply 'linking key measures to strategic objectives that cover different areas of the business'

And at this superficial level, it's true – it does seem relatively straightforward.

However, as you'll have found, the **complexity **comes with trying to fit such a concept into the specific needs of your organization. And as your Practical Strategy approach spreads throughout your organization, more and more people will ask for education and training.

How your organization's 'Pool of Knowledge' looks will depend largely on the **tools** you have at your disposal.

The best solution would be a '**practice area'** with supporting documentation within your scorecard software.

Or, if the people in your organization are big **intranet**** **users, it makes sense to have all the definitions, presentations and other scorecard knowledge in there.

And if you have none of the above, perhaps a **shared folder** on your information network, or even a collection of hard copy information that people can easily refer to.

**Or a mixture** of all of these. At the end of the day, **it depends** how time and money you can afford.

## 9.7. Linking Remuneration to Your Scorecards

One of the best things about using the Practical Strategy approach is that **accountability** can be clearly defined through the ownership of projects, measures, objectives and ultimately, strategies.

However, it pays to **wait a while** before attempting to link any form of staff payment (salaries, bonuses and commissions) to performance results reported in your scorecards.

Why?

Not only will you **drive behaviors** that may not be appropriate (if the objective or measure needs significant adjustment), you run the risk of upsetting key members of staff by 'shifting the goalposts' too often,

Our advice is to **wait at least six months** before using the information generated from your scorecards to reward performance.

And if you do, make sure you **pilot** in one area first - before rolling it out across the organization.

## 9.8. You'll Know You've Got it Right When …

## 9.9. Case Study: What Happened at Hunger Busters?

The week before the first monthly management review, Lara's **phone ran off the hook.**

She fielded **lots of questions** from managers about how to complete their scorecards, what kind of commentary against objectives and measures was appropriate, and in a few cases had to remind people of their ownerships and accountabilities.

The scorecard technology solution also had a **few minor bugs** in it. But all in all, things went reasonably smoothly.

Lara was aware of the critical importance of running an effective first monthly meeting, and spent quite a bit of time **preparing** for it. She had a good idea of the kinds of issues that were going to be raised and had worked hard to make sure she had most of the topics covered.

The CEO was the chairman of the meeting, and as such Lara had discussed with him what the **meeting agenda** should be, prior to sending a copy out to all attendees.

The meeting got off to a bit of a shaky start, when one of the managers got quite vocal about the** time **it had taken him to report on all the scorecard information he was accountable for, and that he hadn't been properly **trained** how to use the scorecard software.

The CEO explained that it was normal for people to take a while to get up to speed with this new approach, and that the senior team needed **to stick with it for a while** before proposing any radical changes.

Lara felt that the unhappy manager had made a few good points, and took extensive notes that she intended to follow up after the meeting.

The meeting progressed broadly in line with the agenda, although Lara had to interject a couple of times to **correct a few misconceptions**. She had already anticipated that this meeting would turn out to be a bit of an on-the-job training session, so it didn't faze her too much.

At the **end of the meeting**, there were a few distinct outcomes:

Several objectives were felt to be **too vague**, and needed re-defining

It was acknowledged that there were still too many **missing measures**, and Lara was tasked with expediting the projects that had already been started to develop them.

Several measures were **unaligned**, and needed some work.

It was apparent that many of the managers were not fully aware of the many **projects** that were supporting the objectives that they 'owned'.

However, the meeting ended on a positive note, with most people commenting that it has been **much more productive** than the previous monthly meeting format, which largely consisted of comparing actuals to budgets - and then apportioning blame.

The monthly meetings continued to run, with ongoing improvements being made based on manager feedback.

And they all lived happily ever after …

## 9.10. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

We're just about to have our first monthly review. How do I ensure it runs well?

First of all, **way before** the meeting, make sure that all of the within your scorecards have owners, and that these owners know how to report progress against them.

This will usually involve explaining how to make a **judgment** on them (eg. good, bad, no change), and how to drive the software (if you're using technology).

Also note that there is a **hierarchy of judgments** that operate within **timeframes**. The owner of an objective cannot decide whether it on track without viewing the judgments made of it's supporting measures (which are most likely owned by someone else).

If you're using a good scorecard technology solution, the timeframe for completing scorecards is **significantly reduced.**

So, assuming that completed their reporting, then next issue you need to be clear on is how the meeting will actually run.

The needs to sit down with the chairman of the meeting (At a Level 1 meeting, preferably the CEO) and **develop an agenda** that will meet the existing needs of the organization whilst also incorporating the new scorecard reporting framework. Here is a

The chairman should then run the meeting according to the agenda, with the support of the Scorecard Manager, should it be required.

# 10. THE CHANGE AGENT'S SURVIVAL GUIDE

I never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can

change the world. Indeed it is the only thing that has.

- Margaret Mead

**Without you**, this guide is worthless.

And we're pretty confident that as you work through the chapters, you'll be able to pick up the 'hard' skills such analyzing data and building measures.

However, that's only half the story. You need to be willing to continually learn more about the **'softer'** skills that help you **engage people** and take them with you on a journey.

There is also a **very real possibility** that you will burn yourself out trying to improve your organization. Strategic change is extremely hard work.

The advice in this chapter comes from our thoughts and experiences on the 'softer' stuff, which coincidentally, will help you **avoid 'burnout'.**

**Please … **take the time to read it before you jump into the 'meaty stuff'.

## 10.1. The Hardest Role …

One of the most difficult (and largely unacknowledged) elements of playing an active role in organizational change is the accompanying requirement for **personal change**.

Make no mistake … the very phrase 'organizational change' is a misnomer.

It disguises the **hidden truth** that organizations are a collection of people, and 'Organizational Change' is really just another phrase for 'Collective Personal Change'.

… and as you know, personal change is usually rewarding - but difficult!

As an agent of change in your organization, your **daily actions and behaviors** will carry more weight than your words.

We've found that a simple and effective way of walking the talk is to **open up your mind** to as much new thinking as you can absorb.

People like to be listened to, and if you can combine an open mind with a desire for results, you're well on the way to success.

Let's be blunt for a second.

Getting your organization focused on strategy and working with scorecards is **hard work**.

**Not everyone** can juggle concepts and assess technology solutions in the morning, and then spend the afternoon planning the next stage of a complex project with their newfound political astuteness.

You'll stretch your intellect, at times feel isolated and unappreciated, unsure if what you're proposing will work, and to top it all, you'll have the **inherent career risk **that goes with being an agent of change (we've all trod on powerful toes in our time!).

And of course, you still have your **'normal job'** to do.

However … you already know that it's not all **doom and gloom**, because you wouldn't be reading this far if you didn't relish the challenge.

It's exciting, no doubt about it.

**Harnessing the energy** of an emotional senior management meeting and using it to define where your company is going can be heady stuff.

As can explaining the concept of a scorecard to a business manager, who instantly gets it!

You're influencing strategic policy, people are **listening to your ideas** … and you're learning heaps of new and interesting stuff!

And of course … you **believe**** **in what you're doing. Which can be a rare commodity these days.

## 10.2. Where Does Your Energy Come From?

A short (and true) story …

Paul loved his job. He was responsible for making sure the company's strategic change program was a success. He **shared ideas** with senior managers. He learned lots from the big budget Information Technology team. He loved **traveling** all round the country speaking and listening to employees.

Paul also liked to run, play soccer, debate international politics, and occasionally climb mountains. This is where he got his **Energy.**

Lots of '**Energy Out'**, and less **'Energy In'** resulted in bags under the eyes, loss of focus and ultimately, a break from the stressful office environment for a while.

Where does your energy come from?

**Nurture it** – you'll need it.

Unless you're the Chairman of the board, the CEO, or the owner of your own company, it's pretty likely that **you'll need the support** from a senior organizational sponsor.

And because you're intending to change both 'hard' stuff (reporting systems) and 'soft' stuff (management behavior), picking the **right sponsor**** **is critically important.

Or if you're sponsor has already been picked … **making sure** they're up to the job! So who is a **good sponsor?** They:

Have substantial organizational authority.

Have the potential to develop an **affinity** for the Practical Strategy approach

Have the ability to **articulate** the changes that will be required and how they will be achieved.

**In short,** they're the kind of leader your organization would like more of.

## 10.4. Your Secret Weapon: A Sense of Humor

A well-developed sense of humor helps **overcome pretense**, puts out the fires of anger and quells hostility.

Using your sense of humor will keep your attitude positive, giving you the ability to **turn around** seemingly impossible situations. Think of it as the 'Great Intangible'.

Use your humor positively, be spontaneous, express your feelings and encourage those around you to do the same.

**Laugh when it hurts.** It also helps if you've got an affirmation you can say to yourself when things aren't going too well.

## 10.5. Don't Become The Job

We don't usually offer **100%** guarantees.

This is the only **exception** …

**" You will not lie on your deathbed wishing you'd **

**spent more time at the office. "**

Spend enough time with family and friends that help you keep your **sense of perspective.**

## 10.6. Recognize the Holistic Nature of Your Task

You've probably come from some sort of **specialist background**, maybe in finance, or operations, or perhaps sales and marketing.

And it's pretty likely that you've been **successful** in your area too (which is perhaps why you're reading this – looking for new challenges).

However, when you work with strategy, you're pulling** **on the **biggest lever** in your organization – a lever that impacts on almost every area of your organization. Sales, Marketing, Operations, Finance, Human Resources, IT - the whole caboodle.

And to be effective, you'll need to develop a **good understanding** of how your organization operates.

So unless you've already had a wide exposure to all these areas, you're going to need to **find people** to educate and support you. Start putting together your shortlist of potential candidates now.

## 10.7. Practical Tips

**Why **do most change initiatives fail? Because organizations are facing…

Strong **resistance to change** – from senior management down to the front lines

Skepticism and cynicism towards yet another '**flavor of the month'** change effort

Lack of **dedicated sponsors** for change

Turf issues, business unit barriers, and **'silo mentalities'**

**Chaos and turbulence** with no clear vision for change nor future organizational direction

The Practical Strategy approach **will fail** if you ignore these issues.

Which is exactly why we've covered the most important ones on the next few pages …

### 10.7.1. Challenge 1: Strong Resistance to Change – From Senior Management Down to the Front Line.

The key to lowering resistance to the Practical Strategy approach is to run effective and **practical**** **workshops that tackle **real **business problems.

In these workshops managers need to understand how the problems being discussed **impact on them**, both indirectly and directly.

**Involve people.** Show them how both they **and **the organization can benefit from this approach.

### 10.7.2. Challenge 2: Skepticism and Cynicism Towards Another 'Flavor of the Month' Program.

Actions speak **LOUDER **than words.

With the Practical Strategy approach, when you make the personal commitment, positive outcomes **come fast** - and can be presented and understood easily.

If you're organization is skeptical, simply ask for** 90 days** to prove that this approach is different from other initiatives. Most management teams are willing to sponsor an approach for a finite period if the new activity shows positive results within that time.

If you can't get their attention **within 3 months**, you're either doing it wrong, or they're not interested in change.

### 10.7.3. Challenge 3: Lack of Dedicated Sponsors For Change

You need to ensure that management is supportive of the Practical Strategy framework as a whole new way of thinking and doing business - not just as a new 'tool'. **Identify the specific benefits** of this approach that will have the largest positive impact on your organization.

Make sure your sponsors know that they need to publicly **and regularly** communicate their support of the process - guide them in understanding their role as sponsors of new thinking.

### 10.7.4. Challenge 4: Turf Issues and Silo Mentalities.

Many of the issues you'll come across will be rooted in the beliefs of a structure-led organization **versus** a strategy-led organization.

This is especially true if you work in a matrix organization (combining line management and functional responsibilities), which theoretically is designed to encourage multi-tasking and greater efficiency. In organizations such as this, many managers **lose sight** of the bigger picture.

The Practical Strategy approach creates **clear accountabilities** based on strategic outcomes - not organizational structure.

This may challenge your organization initially. However, if you persevere you'll find that this approach makes it clear that **strategic outcomes** are paramount to the success of the business rather than job descriptions or organizational structure.

### 10.7.5. Challenge 5: Chaos and Turbulence with no Clear Vision or Organizational Direction.

Management meetings become **focused** on the change required through target projects and initiatives.

Also, given that this approach is ideally* *delivered to managers via their desktop (by means of an appropriate technology solution), **every manager** in the business can see how changes will affect the business.

People will resist the change. Listen to them - withhold judgments. Change is never an entirely positive experience; communicate why people need to adopt the change NOW, and what it will **look and feel like** when it is fully implemented.

# 11. ABOVE ALL, REMEMBER THIS …

The biggest things are always the easiest to do because

there is no competition.

- *William Van Horne*

This is a **summary** of Practical Strategy in 7 pages.

**Get (and keep) Senior Management Team commitment.** Without it, you're dead in the water. Don't stray too far from your sponsor.

**Strategy is 'WHAT you want, and HOW you're going to get it'****. **Burn this definition into everyone's brain.

**Strategy operates at different levels in your organization.**** **You need to be able to articulate how strategy is different from structure.

**Be clear on the parts of your organization you're intending to develop strategy for**. The senior team? The whole organization? Consider a pilot approach in a few well-chosen areas, across a number of levels.

**The better your analysis, the (much) better your strategies.** Many people make the mistake of speeding through the analysis stage. Don't. Your analysis forms the foundation for all your strategic development. Make sure you spend enough time understanding your organization's challenges and opportunities. Talk to people!

**Avoid 'paralysis by analysis'.** Strive for excellence, not perfection. If it all gets 'too hard' go back to asking the simple questions.

**Don't rush to answers too quickly**. A night spent sleeping on a new idea often provides a great return on investment.

**Don't pluck your objectives from thin air** (yes, people actually do that!). Develop them logically from the key issues that your analysis uncovers.

**Don't get bogged down on the wording of your Strategic Themes and Objectives**. Capture the essence of what you're trying to say, and then if you need to, get your marketing people to find better words.

**Carefully consider the pros and cons of using Functional Strategies. **If your functional areas (such as Marketing, HR and IT) are quite complex, you may need to develop a few. However, don't add complexity if you don't need to.

**Sketch out your initial Game Plan as soon as you can.** It will help focus discussion and assist peoples understanding of the **Thinking ****@**** Levels** concept.

**Measures MUST be linked to objectives.** Strategic alignment is the most common mistake that most organizations make when developing measures.

**Don't let your attachment to existing performance measures stop you from developing new ones.** Your measures are where the 'rubber hits the road' – don't be using retreads!

**Align your projects to your objectives. **If your organization is committing lots of resources to one-off initiatives, make sure they're supporting your strategic goals.

**Make sure you have a formal (and easy-to-use) Project Methodology.** It's the easiest way to keep track of project progress.

**Don't underestimate the critical importance of your reporting and communication tools. **Your information and performance management systems are your organization's 'neural network'.

**Choose your technology well – pilot, then grow.** Unless you're very tech-savvy, find someone you trust before making any major technology decisions. Make sure the technology you select supports your methodology.

**Clear ownership and accountability for Strategic Components are vital**. If nobody can be held to account for results, all your efforts will have been in vain.

**Don't underestimate the need for education and training.** The scorecard concept is simple, but the effects on your organization are huge.

**Don't use your scorecard to gain more top-down control.** Your employees will (quite rightly) rebel.

**The first and second meetings after you've implemented your scorecard are critical! **Don't make the mistake of taking your foot off the gas too soon. Use your scorecard information as the foundation of the agenda for your monthly management meetings. Be careful that people don't fall back into old behaviors.

**Don't underestimate the extra administration and time required for scorecard reporting****. **Poor scorecard administration is the silent killer. Out-of date or inaccurate information poisons credibility.

**The effectiveness of your new monthly reporting process is an important success indicator.** When people stop attacking the process (or the scorecards) and start talking about the issues in the business – you've got it right.

**Challenge your strategies regularly – it'll keep you on top.** Your Intellectual Property is the only thing that differentiates you in the long term. Don't neglect it.

**Change is the norm.** Do everything in your power to help other people understand this. Help them see that that they can open their arms to change without** **letting go of their values.

**Don't be politically naïve.** This approach is likely to cover several of your 'organizational empires', and may threaten some senior managers. Don't tread on too many toes too soon. Get some momentum rolling first.

**It'll get hard sometimes****.**** **Find out what keeps you topped up with energy and motivation, and keep doing it!

**Don't trade your sanity for a job title.** It's only a job. You will not lie on your deathbed wishing that you'd spent more time at the office.

**Make it fun!**** **Laughter is by far the most effective 'organization lubricant'.

For not-for-profit organizations this is usually the 'bottom' perspective – the foundation for all other perspectives and objectives to be built upon.

However, it has one significant shortcoming. It doesn't state the most important (yet widely misunderstood) characteristic …

**Strategy is a Process!**

Most people believe that strategy is a 'static' concept, one that is addressed at fixed points in the business calendar – usually yearly.

In times of continuous change, this thinking is fundamentally flawed. Strategy needs to continuously take account of evolving market conditions and trends.

An example of a Strategic Theme is 'Lead the Fast Food Race'.

**Strategic Theme Owner**

The person responsible for reporting on the status of a – normally on a monthly basis.

For a Level 1 Strategic Theme, this would normally be the CEO. For a Level 2 Strategic Theme, this would normally be a Business Unit or Regional Manager

**Strategy Map**

The graphical representation of a strategy. Contains a (WHAT is to be achieved) and a collection of (HOW it will be achieved).

In essence, Strategy Maps present the collective thinking of a management team.

Product Quality

Service Quality

Price

Image

Relationship
